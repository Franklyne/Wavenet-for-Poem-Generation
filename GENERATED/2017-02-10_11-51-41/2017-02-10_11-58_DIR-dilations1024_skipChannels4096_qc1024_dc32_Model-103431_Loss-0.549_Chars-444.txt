 THAT LIFE   


sarcapagoad waves like most kind apart 
in which you must rescind now 

memory is a gray-ribbed crocus   
only men clean the dispossibility   
unshelter off the white hole remained 

in cold snow his dale of parts.


the poets into my hair hard demon sustain   
love i saw him swirls 
and another peace more love   
hooked on his cheeks singless   
wounded ahead for air across there 
in a fertile tooth 
older ths incommon 

on mi

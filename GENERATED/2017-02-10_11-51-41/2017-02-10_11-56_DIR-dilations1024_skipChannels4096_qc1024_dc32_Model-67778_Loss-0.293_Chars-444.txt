 DRAB TEA 


nurtures in all the alien can

that have been than the eye hang hickor the sky
for advance of the trash
 the crenched in the dark
aboveing in the middle of elm reconciled,

scarlet hanging in the strand of the
heavy be its mouth
the white floor killed pack rolled us 
in his bucket, the smell of the imperial unit.


                                                                      and laughs and rove 


a sound

 FROM ONE.


  
 i don't lifted the poets and tug my father's best
 lantern with tenderly injured the fence
 it gotten by the oaks, a moon. devoured
 the landscape karest into our mere into wings.

in the wild glories of the trenches
supple squirrels.

the motorboat is gone

for lengthens in the calm,
 and more on the sum

over theorems more and the house.
and the stars 

of manners wait for their small and roaring

and tinged beneath a dog
on

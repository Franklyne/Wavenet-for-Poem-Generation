 THE OTHER


 mackerel jays round the poor nobody in beds 
 when hibernatan pigeons, sack in body bend.


i am the one faces in the ears          and the air
here than answers
out on his house
 into his cat
black sea for breath
 your bone
 keeps the boat together
 and the lord
 i am twilight
  
 an ariane
 manvap-tound and lash
  
 black eyes dropped
  
 that in the drinking sky
 degrees' brand' 
  
 pulse and growing 
 gravelstitute
 new heat

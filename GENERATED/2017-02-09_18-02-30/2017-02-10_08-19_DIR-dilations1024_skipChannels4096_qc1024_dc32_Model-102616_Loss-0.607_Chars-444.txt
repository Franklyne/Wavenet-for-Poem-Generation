   THAT MAYBE MOLTEN MY DIVINITY IS STILL PLAY OUT


only the pocket walls, the manager jest
these wealth waking.
                                       they pretended first, dust

one momentum mind
and rode up in their faces
the peicker's boys
her big bronze
laid i touch my age,
and that hells orbitation --

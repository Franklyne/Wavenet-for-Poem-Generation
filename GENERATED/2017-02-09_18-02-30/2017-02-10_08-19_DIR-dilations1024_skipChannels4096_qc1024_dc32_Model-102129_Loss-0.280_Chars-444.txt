 THE SHADE OF SAND


 recalculable dropping back.


take a black jubriarism,
 a derelict
that swam in a stink.
  with a slicid bear keeps
 marks of one meen fench
 claiming in the parking lot,
 that grave across the stairs



stranger of shopping dusk
 into the threat
 in attic looking back
 i thought these hath
 that july 
 plans sweep of my ghouls
 that wants to belief
 an engines flat, its
  
 drain affectation of the dark 
 by sunset loops

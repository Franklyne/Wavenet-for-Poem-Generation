 UNTIL HISS AND STONES


 dig partly, honed manly and turned people to the sink,
i danced out there is our soul.


the name remembering life
 machines with the thrush door even i wouldn't fathom sure and let me sped
 not your legs and all those letters of golden indians? there is the rest.
indeed,
                          iv
or dog of a big bad its name. i return in prayer are dlod
  
 and of us written swim the leaving lawns
       champagne

         THE MATCHBOOT,


           when i slash machines and later loft and plank
                                                                  with cherrye wants to be lifting in world. i see the cry of heav'n, regards the fame. 

lore heartening to reveal the rooms of her on sun still hurts
your mittal edges of having and drakes. because of us, near a slover--
he writes, on the scene of knife. i know i didn't, so amate
i love your eyes

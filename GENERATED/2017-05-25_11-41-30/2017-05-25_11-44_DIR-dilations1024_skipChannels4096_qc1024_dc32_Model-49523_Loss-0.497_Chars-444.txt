 IT WERE TO BE


      parsley heightie nightmares
 no public we to this world,
 a razor in the moon with borrows to
 on untemptory, the high dumped

                         it multitude
 which a simple boy 
   to speak the wheeze of cacero
 in her skin.
  
       out of a claw,
 below the sun
 when
 and never tire calling
  
  
 and paul, one another
 as a holy cluster
  
 i know all you wore
  
 to the horizon
to move the road in the market

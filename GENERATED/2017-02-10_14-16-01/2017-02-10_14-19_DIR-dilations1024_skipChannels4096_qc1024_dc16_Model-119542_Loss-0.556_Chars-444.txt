 SOMEWHERE THE LIVING POT.


 
and a power. rhythmic liberty
 every day i coconte-thick 
you'd hired the slit of being put you saw
no scary, cool seven, sigh

is glanced wiles, jim, send your eyes

garage with accurately need worry
anything else would be born
cheerode, they say, their soft colors

ah, in acts. one came into my ghost
above a well.
 
all falling out letter, by moonlight.


the call, i'll call

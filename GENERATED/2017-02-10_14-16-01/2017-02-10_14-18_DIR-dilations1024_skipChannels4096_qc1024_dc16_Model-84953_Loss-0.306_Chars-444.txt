 AROUND A BIRD,


  
 he chose to some old float in depressively
  
 he is alive with lives now his life
 or maybe it's the unn makager
 and rat-a-tat-atop from an apron
 seeing.
  
 i cannot name trumpet before a letter
 to the soft still at his little daughters of desire
 and now in brooklyn.
  
 such a thing salt and a crops in her barn,
 
 cabbage going back and glitter thundering
 when you've never did, swivel two that once caught with it

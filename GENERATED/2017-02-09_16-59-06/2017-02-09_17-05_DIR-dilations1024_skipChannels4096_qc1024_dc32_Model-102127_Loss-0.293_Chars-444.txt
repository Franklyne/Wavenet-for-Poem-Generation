 TURNS AND OF BLUE AGAIN


 there was a glass of figures of man
 my breast by history, keeled the songs of the yards.
 to my right love we know what an atoms 
 
 a thousand ocean of desire on them cant
 the ocean due and someone who sink like stone
 the tram appealing of her threat, health,
 that will say again and roses--
 the same as thy fathers. but i returned
 in the sprawling jacob's flat like a field,
 into the intellect works like that

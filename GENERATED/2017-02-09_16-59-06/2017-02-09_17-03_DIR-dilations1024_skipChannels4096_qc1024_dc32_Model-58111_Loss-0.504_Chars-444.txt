           WILD


  
  
  
 you in the love
  
  
  




the shophard, murdered
 wounded

pennies my potsniving
 to take my face
 not a voice.
  
 they packed me away
on the english
is talking,
 lonelier?



everything to be around eye.
  
 the whole hotel
 away
 all wood,
 an early park's bliss
 stains upon
  
 time to be burnt under the tires,
like someone as possible to light
 and raised as the squirm of this
 who found myself

 WITHIN THE KKS. UNDERNEATH.




dear the west she's native crab-poking is the blunt dawn sokiated sister of . . . i see your eyes,
 fall obedientiguas and a white cloud's tacks of knees,
i pray the least, letters and empty flights, the mind of the socket of absurd,
whip the bad garden's daybrean after powboy i hold the empire
                                                             under for us he kept its place

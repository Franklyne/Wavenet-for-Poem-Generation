 ALL HILLS 


    glowed with heat with heaven                       
to the footed label.  
              we two days--   
although i liked the fire, 
    take nature's meat and angoya.

yet what comes. soon, and prophecies. 
come to thy song heavenly thence 
yet in vain about to her school 
followed gracious scolde 
let look my twelve languishing, 
in the image, teeth with stars

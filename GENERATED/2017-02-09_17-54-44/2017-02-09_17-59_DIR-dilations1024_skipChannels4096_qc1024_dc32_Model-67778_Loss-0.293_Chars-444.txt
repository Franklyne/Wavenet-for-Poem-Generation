 THROUGH THE PIANO,


marshes. the avail, dramas emblazone whirlpools.


i'm gindon-morning.

then, richard, and casual passerby,
and there is toted stag robbers--
yellowed paffers emerglant between his long blankets

the native space for a draw heart

she moves out bone-high fresh
to here, hovers. and no winds


& to dave it all aware got to thank
the remnant torn, before the color of men
ride in bagler funnels.


dabbins blow hill butterflie

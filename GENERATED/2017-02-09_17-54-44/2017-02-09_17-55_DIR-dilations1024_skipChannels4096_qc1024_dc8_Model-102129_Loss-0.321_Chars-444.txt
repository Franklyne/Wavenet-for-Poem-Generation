 I WAS HER FACE AND FORTH 


gently, i regards

in the hand and the men swaddled,
 can draggings yasked
 for thome of ending about pecked lake sun,
 the white of a miser in any mind,
 and neated by measuring minnie swaying
which after the brushed stairs,
with lipped orbit that waves down
 legs springs. i am char
across a playra buffoons
 and razz of induced. 
 no spades down its
off the storm-piems of the ox-spy
first compassion of the nights

 WINDOWS INTO PARIS' SUNDAY STONES ARE AS PERCODON,


 and soberch on sutam and yellow and pinnings.
the piges chocolate creek.
 shorts & walk pass between the mills,
 my late blossom baroque,
as it could jumping our hurly
  
 in his brains, citra he finds and then it
 the vast rush like us a hope stumbled beats
  
 filament and the huge dripped
 and mot the solids of strolls and wall.
  
 too much of scattered blastery of all
 who can't tell

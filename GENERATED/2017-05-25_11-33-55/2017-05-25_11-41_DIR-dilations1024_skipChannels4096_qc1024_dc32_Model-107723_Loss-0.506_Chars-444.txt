 A MAN UNTO 


               mee true 
                  

   i went to cheape. 

               all a wedith shall know, 
as the sweet die--sensual 
         my child his little son lover 
       i would walk away like states, 
or               no just a delicious flow, 
as that saphirs can do i weave leaves
      old vain wonder may have sat 
    made your mouth i lay this pale one 
    not loved the welkin marriage 
    as with uncle's kin

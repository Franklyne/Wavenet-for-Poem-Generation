         ME THE SILVER


  
 and the furies' spreading necklace
 of the malarial exploding an allice
 her sunken be burst and rakes and merry
  
 from st. fresh
  
 perose and swam preyseless winding to me,
 he dragged stone make me until the needs,
 get one sad and dad small human-six
 her hand against the news of the windshield,
 brooks the wildflowers rearranges.
  
 lead the branches on the earth,
 at the end of magpies and line with light

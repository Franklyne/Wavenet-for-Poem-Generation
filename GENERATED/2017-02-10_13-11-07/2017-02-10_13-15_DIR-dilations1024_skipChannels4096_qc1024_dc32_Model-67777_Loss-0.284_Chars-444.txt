 A GLASS.


watch with god and handcuffed--
the grease globe was on the vines
who were curse coin to intent
the butler, tricks in the respirator
of a silver in the moaning 
softly and are crumpled figure--
makes e husk them lisp to turn from
his standing silver sat in its 
let the cool, facing the shell
of splendid electricity.
the revolution of structure-brown
and dwelling throughout, the summer
of ill and cat even knoweth stars.

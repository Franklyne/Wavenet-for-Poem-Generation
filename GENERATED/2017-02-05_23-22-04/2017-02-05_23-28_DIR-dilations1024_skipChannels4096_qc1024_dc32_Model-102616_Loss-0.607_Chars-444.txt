 TO REASSUME,--MAN HE FLUNG IT 


dark doing and swell grasing
and this noon what looking rock, and years
undergoing there. month and ritual,
a painted and feel heat that tugged at this
was sewing my faces
bags, like swans and bodies
on a smile lives
i hear him home.
in sixteen
how this young pieces
one lives him
only sounds given
to rest in this
soon 
because the dark
ivory, and the cold
shine the lion's
on my penison
sun, surpasses
one light

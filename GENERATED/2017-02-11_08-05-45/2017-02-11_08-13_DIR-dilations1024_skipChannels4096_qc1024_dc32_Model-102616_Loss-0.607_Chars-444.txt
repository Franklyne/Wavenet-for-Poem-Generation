that far with a solid man. 

he is the door. i rub again.

when i spun undecence.

all everyone and

the skies,
i existingly

astride my life.

i wasn't step and go ahead.
they never slip
in that good
as a new english sky

next to a wing?

a good will i now.
and when

almost headed
together in the childish
barking me silence

under skies
squat phalla
like the wheel

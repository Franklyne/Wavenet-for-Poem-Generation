 UP THERE AFTER THE RAY COMES


night to her scuple,
 i'm pured harbors
and harbor and black sabunjazz happy.
till i answer color. so down the land.
  
 over stop being every far away at the tiny house
 and is on his bald with their mother,
 i say my max and her pencil-edie at a traffic,
high and told me, and to our eyes
like caught in towns that sound into a walk
and muckles the girth to the name of words
that was a coffin i'm evidence. well,

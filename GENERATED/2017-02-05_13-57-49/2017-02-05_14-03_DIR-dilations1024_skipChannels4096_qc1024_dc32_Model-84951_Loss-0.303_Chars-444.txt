 MOUTH AND A HUSKY HEAT


on the wall, our bodies were rubbed 
at the man born taking. still, continue formed. over
the decision that will never through hard drug.
but the nutrimed breathes her new 
swinging & peadowed hair.



laughing hope me the past is old coffee
and in vulnerable
their ways in them on the symbol
and the flashy mountains is illusions of an open--

hammer and plank, and the answer is the only car 
beyond the phrase washingt

 DRAFTED FOR THE LOGO BASTARD HIM



handed so one coming.... i, insects amends.
been dark in unseen

a rainstorming and the angels are
crossed them,
on a cold made in pastel basket.
last words we bear me,
rainbow...cat the lake cheeks.
an island in the bag,
who seek. i mocked
away.


today's alph up
massage. so reuses.
              slight
silver. i know


back
& your backs
however, what

the sun on our
leck and   do with a low michelangelo's

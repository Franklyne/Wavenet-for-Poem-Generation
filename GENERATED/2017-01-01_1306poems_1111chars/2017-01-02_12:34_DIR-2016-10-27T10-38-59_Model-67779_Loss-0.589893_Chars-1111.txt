 I MIGHT OF THE FLY,


      a marriage keeps it beside the balconies

the past-fields.

who oozes the hill and mackwards,
                   death
  
 masks fast asleep of nailing sorts of interjection,
                     dominishing on earthly about? 
                                                       left.



                              we were keep,
                                                 sings
                               watching down the cane
                                                 awake, alero is there he has
  
                            fram's voice
                      the diatoms and stone.
 you're rick the last of his octogenarian granular
                                                     --than . . .                    sings.

 to the tolian culture.
 
              go away.
  
                                                     rig haven't my demons
                                                            the time 

              without that uncloud

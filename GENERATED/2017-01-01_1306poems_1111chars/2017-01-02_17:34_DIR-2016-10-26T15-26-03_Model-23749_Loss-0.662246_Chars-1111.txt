      THE TOWNS 


  
 a lizard's stories on my cheek
 say as a city bench
  
 circuit over the run-flate back,
 physically with a scarifying swell
 by the orange
 my skin
  
  
 a weep in the memory
 presumers
 upon
started and that is tedious 
 acton but,
at all in her name adapted,
                                      and the horizon old
 schubn take me crop by bright
 the cooling mind
             at the baitist post-out in a correspond dented
                      wheks you up
 in discourage that white
    your fister of loss and paint glass
             and solid oil like the water open
 is petal looks passages 
 is this the circle of mind filthy tangs
  
  
 fland shower. then when you
 but harden alone  out, the beast
  
 almost to catch you--yes, in his clody
 her pockets, spotless princes fall.
  
    iii
 
 driftin you only spoken.
  
 expirins, buck-new? have
measures for
 has sufficient--
 it now left of unequate see
 this bench enter birds to it.
  
 alight with eagles--but cut you
 characters and forth
 invariable keepful cloud
        the way the evening
 still live in escruciable

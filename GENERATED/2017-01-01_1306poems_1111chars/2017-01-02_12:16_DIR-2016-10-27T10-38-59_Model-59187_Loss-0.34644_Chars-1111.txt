the long ran connection, breezes
white thrills. a four--wanting
 way of the hallway has made.

all the baby of his back
shaped like the tiny could belong

i loved the woodpile
and if you're catch me
about than in
rips of her nose
floral wood sosranged
down the first dangle-faced stalk
become a piece of
small as jimisgier flock
and gombrownwake huth,
when the summer now as polymic
wanting her kleenexix.
the beard of assembly barges

be will moves from the sand
with head and arthropols
pain january, and the havoc
shirts of roman
in her head against soul
when no boot complaint tremblost
and patient and the tung

not bratbook shilling birds 
the seeds of the beach
but the line paths of the letters.


touch is empty leaning

as though ain't the black 
to say, argu

from influxes order,
when all you might
every moveme

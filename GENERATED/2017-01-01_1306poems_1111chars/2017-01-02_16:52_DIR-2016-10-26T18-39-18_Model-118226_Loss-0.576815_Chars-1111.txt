 CROSS, SOMETHING THE WINDOW 


 when every national morning on the pines in his pockets
 are count, tiny planned a grandma's ears. from
as i need to the fields anne, sewing
 connections. the dream of the language.
 thing and his ladders were all over elsie.
 nothing neighborhood on his belt. the invisible ter tons
 suspended car
 get a puppled other,
 truly barge to fruits as ecstasy, turn me and mischief
as i could created to be trautest that absurd get it
 windows and an unforgiving rain cries   
becoming junctured tunabout its own on the ground
 back to the circus where i sound for its right again.
  
 .  



  
  
 strange is filtered by tending the sixty years

 
a perfect concrete photographs.
 sand pick men are stares a bent to do we shrink
 primitive faces,
                                         in my coat,
 broken precisely into
                        to run
      sing surprise and stares its jaw
 midnight to commercials dances,
 their fragrant promising is
sidney on meeting my hatch,
 the difficult thirty wagon
 surrounding square.
  
 it's great
cast like this fears ground no doubt.

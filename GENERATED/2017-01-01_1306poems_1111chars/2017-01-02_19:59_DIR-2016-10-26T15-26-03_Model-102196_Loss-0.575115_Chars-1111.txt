       TO NATURE UNTIL THE CHILDREN 


  
 iii. it is slick? belinded from the wind,
 not brought me over the devil's run fan.


for to nice dawn depris can't be hiding
 our ugly drag freestly post, bubbly except dose.
 and quietous, who skid band braced for sun
  
 'tice amazed and myaueees, the ghosts and go,
 supporting-wheel as the colour of quintess
 blazing me? there is no one less secrefie
 and in popeyed air only thing and tombis wilderness,
 the pomegranate. raining spiral toh.



at first

david's for composting its fine-toasting water
 he'll seam a public yet.


he flopped at twilight three
  
 old fur wara about man's 
paint absorb?
  
 sam an unequan park and secretly
 tympt the falcon phrase
 the plane and gum,
 at topplina, trade, all blinds as virgil's -
 their tidy tree thoughts which breaking,
 the kind of moth he'll lie into 
 it falls are a vanishing another 
 is bamboo on the park in the golden gate
 terraquin leaf his spirit. 
 they, yet put praise just soft
 to the ideal man, keeping them.
 blurring, your untitled bruised kingdom.
  
 my bright drag me from wood, and broke.

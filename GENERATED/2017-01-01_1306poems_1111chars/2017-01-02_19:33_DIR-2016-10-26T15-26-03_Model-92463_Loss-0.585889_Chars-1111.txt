 BE WELCOME YOU



i pull that dogwood from the only for the opening irishman's,
 no, it was not him do now?
  
 what had the chain of portrait.
  
 gone to kiss you bloated on his panic
 i had me my copper neither evil
 that was losing the highway colored,
 along with one knew victories,
  
 o the sometimes a passenger, 
                                           accepts,
 singing on andy
  
 suturing the breath sagging,
 a beautiful life to the earth
 plunks its horror
                                       on the run-down and in one is war.
                          thou nibbed her hair morning after 
                     then we do with sea. in it
                                   you pray
  
  
                         to get at
 stones in the sun-lit,
  
               or lazarus
  
                 from the road showed in,
                   not move.
 sometimes i'd always snowing what we are on
        was but the problem isn't
 we just passes, the principle of our town
                          it has given me theresis
         but words
             from another

 IN THE WIND


 hamburger will be silent where we borrow
  
  
  
  
 by location.
  
 we float a tree
pure stroke,
  
  
 
all which has a sayin's
filigree mourning
 all our drowning
        sold black
of survivors 

to put a dately
 wondered window,
 so spring our guest
 like the husky gray
 then got the rolls with him.


this light mockery.

  
 a voice that every hours,
  
  
 empty one footpad
 and just

someone 
 am i drinkeported 
 through the smoking,
 fingernail
into the fraggin drendles, hazewing
 a one-eyed fisher the most kisses
  
 we're only to orchest
 the languages do not have
instead we return,  and up
  
  
 facing someone's parts
  
 and sometimes, desolate
 savor holy bother here
 cliffs outside, you
would be moved or falling
 tunes blown, light the sun.
  
  
 black and
 wet she flies, 'spots,
 the nevers and held
          named
move the light like thine tender
 of receiver came
 becoming or friend mirror.
 come, crowded with bird windows.

 i watch elsewhere.
 
the liturgy in blade?
 in its smooth squirrel
 by roots upon bypredish.


 
    
  
 and holy though much to the to

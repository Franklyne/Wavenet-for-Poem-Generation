 AND SOMEONE ELSE,


those crawled spines, duplly on my breton lip so clear dark, from a wall.


afternoon of what yesterday matinecrated, no has long 
for fear
 to the wreckage, were the mama watch and dim surries spread
my family own dry calibrate in me no escaped in a blow-flame
if i step into plaza still play got with a fake--i fall from a spoon
folks above the braceless part? and degroes over a tune all nicessing
i could under tufh a hoodlums dino left only flesh awake roburger. 
the fear is consort. and at that small.

foghornd into its folded half-sitting
save been smoking back to sing except
nacily, sunshine, comes out move

poke-winder watching the wave

the rain once proud of diets
 house an official, to hear
to hear them fisher, half 
in finest slipping. my favorited rocked 
for doubt. what lubbed flower 
your razor
to crowned turning why tender missed
into its mergently togetherly
with your lover's doors
      not weighing
               
the horse's volume   
termite this way
of accusing

accompani never please 
more sugar-
 syves gang the frevels on.

there're dead you

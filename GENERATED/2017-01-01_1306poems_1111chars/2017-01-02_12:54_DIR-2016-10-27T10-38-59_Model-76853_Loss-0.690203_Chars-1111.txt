 AT TWENTY-ONE


we darnstile better
entirely....and the shelter with us,
the wind white weather this roaring square
of his mouth of nothing. some of us arrived old
and remote the old spiral has young men
one man with a secret. in my iron me
the organ cheap floor by dorst smote is all 
and been instruments that sens up to the top
a delr in white in the damask in tiny the

revolutions of women dead 
& must happened
into swept

as if in rings,
lipstick mud

a gauch
i'm visited by the studies

everything 
o tascase of her in the rope's

is lost. a moment noon
for it.


but, he called because
the great depot,

peroyalize to fill through the piano,
but the balloon furred
those long i once
would scraps thrums and shape
a shine strife,
a hawk to be kings the first time
to think
i'll suddenly, anthony orning
my stay or even like
no brave as before rang
to hear it
and the blow

and instead dumb sweet 
my favoriteerus

i bengo with summer leakroom
thangs will be devoured
back in
you're meant wails
slowed in little kingdom
it's beauty, forebody in your living
she tells us to feet
the last packet
in the land

 DRIBBLED OVERHEAD



as doorknab becomes invaded
over two whirlpool
only the knock oak moving
over its one-man
beings as my cutting

not like that,
her beauty and 
to the undulates
of your teeth.

how many of history.
i wanted to this
small blue instruments
against their coils
played rock ripped
of sweat

and salt of existence gangs
bright haze
like the smell
once a singular clapboard,
my home.
faithless like that
taught available
family know

 LODGED TO CLOUT, 


    unable to hearts expected. 
but i will deal how to scave me die. 
             that is not a peaceful ornament, 
a clear jacob win the landinghame 
                                            -- 



what blame an empty a seawer seize 
make love pain in sight, the end. 

                   the play 
                         wait, 
my mercy one voice, i saw. 

             with all it self to seek

   SINCE THEM INTO A SCENE DAY


  
 i rested by at long as the gapscopine door
 winds in watery thoughts, the loins' fate again.
  
 drenched our times behind the clinic green
 and all my bones near the height of breasts.
 o resemblis suddenly occupiel and civil to birth,
 a trait tax. once against the shest of sobs.
 there is no numbers whisperers' trying to show 
 and who is many a slipper, as we can't accordant
 with pleased rebivoun ocean

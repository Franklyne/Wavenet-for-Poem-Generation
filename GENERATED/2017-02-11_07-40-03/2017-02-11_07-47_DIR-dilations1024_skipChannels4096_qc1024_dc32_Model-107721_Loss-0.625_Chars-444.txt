       THAT EVERY LAWN



was not awake the gates quick 
   the bower of the world
completely beauty conceive 
   who wax next windescribe 
soumps, and lips, take me 
a winter state bemurrock's skill 
   driven thee let its gut my passions, 
and yet on false, must needle 
   we think god hath may not 
he can die in vain 
we see am he broke he loved. 

   that which is undressed 
but love's spite hath echoes 
    only by stupefish 
of the song

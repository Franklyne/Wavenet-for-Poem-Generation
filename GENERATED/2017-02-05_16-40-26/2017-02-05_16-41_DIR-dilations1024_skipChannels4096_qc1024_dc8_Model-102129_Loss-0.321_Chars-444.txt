 CALL THEM


by the noiseless circles of doors.
 i heard which valour drink
 through the seas, and mary.
 in this it does--
to be marriage plague-,
you had my bosom born?
 angels of palos still and be told,
 of fires before the world was to me
 and when desire uproot dock,
but a woman wedged in the wing,
 little off the field's diesels bound, i
though we have a quarter around
 crashed you wouldn't be come you were her,
time. each off your head

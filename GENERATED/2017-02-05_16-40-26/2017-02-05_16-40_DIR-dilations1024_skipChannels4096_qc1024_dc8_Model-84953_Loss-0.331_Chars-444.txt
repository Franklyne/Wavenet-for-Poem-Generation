 OF US 


a greyhound, caught on slivers,
i'd fix whoever is blowing 
through the mast grows and gag-linus the moon
on the mouths, but hold back or passing forward
i was are ready to entry in comma spacecrio
to each other.
the tading of a kiss
 makes of the slogan whose lost in my plastic lungs
weight convinced, under the sky,
hoard-, fund of the thought one,
my heart hoist in the coasts of her own the others.


in the swiss crank and will hea

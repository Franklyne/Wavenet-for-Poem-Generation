 ELEMENT HAVE LEFT


sailing the queen and graces--and singing ship
 then i have to live the telephone
                              trying to burn
                              i pass and blue-green, 

the skyline railed vaultlement annoy dash-
lunatic as slam.


            protect me through the thoughts 
 i went by questions to dark,
and muylry brown maple as the quiet which
 prairie--lost in the game of freed.
 here we end, you can do it

clasped with delight be mar 
sweet larcessed contest 
we deck walked in withered 
in penitence gander
beauty mine element in thee,

the stalk terms bey designed, 
which devysi, when i keep, 
what thou art goody day. 

and some peaceful with the world 
unpleasures and body 
till you sea come, 
the blessed hearts no less 
save beyond to me unclos'd
her dare let conceived sunbaked, 
by cleft of kingdoms slain

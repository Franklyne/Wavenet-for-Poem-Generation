 INSIDE A PROMISCUOUS QUIETLY SLIM.


its tails, sing the last walking accent-on.


the ambient coated like a dog or else the man
blank gaze for the cot and you can cause a poet?

only you had of the noise.
and you, yes, friday. we could hear 
in love. i have busy farmers falling in your voice.

sorrow. light
at last i get on sput horse, capsize evenings
call me memory of tassie for bloomless colors
loss shoulders bubble him now....

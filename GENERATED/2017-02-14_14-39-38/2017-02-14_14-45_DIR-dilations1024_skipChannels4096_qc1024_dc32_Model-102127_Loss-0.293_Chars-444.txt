 WHAT FALLS AWAKE GOT UP


 the mouth, drop in.


there was a web of confederate their ways--

 iii


the undevellan seas
tearing ground
my lips but lexico
at i write waist

we sat on a large bow log,
pockets the window


knee-deep in the occasions,

the several actresses of sound
on calaby heatacts
of the distances


the way the air

themselves in at sea

talking ashes,
clopping the hand
which dilates from the
attracts that ha,
rain wi' more

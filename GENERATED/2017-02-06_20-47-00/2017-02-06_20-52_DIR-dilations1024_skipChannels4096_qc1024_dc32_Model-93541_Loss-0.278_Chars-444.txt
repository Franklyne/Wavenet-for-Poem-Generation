 THE SION


  
 the thought beloved of their from the verge
 with a dry non-filled with quietly,
 the phrase, the place is something.
 my eyes opened slow fans save happy
 lonely in land.

along the engines like a mercy savour
 more than the graves
falls into the air, sinan

and grave the gates of a train
we live like the bedpod birds,
dust sexy & stem

on our lips, outlast on

starry-glaw the passerby
lineaments you knew
exactly that great so

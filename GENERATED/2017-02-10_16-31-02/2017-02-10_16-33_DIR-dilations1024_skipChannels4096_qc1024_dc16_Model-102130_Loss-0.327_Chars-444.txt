 DECKED BY A SMILE


from on the sea
  
                              the yellow after that it was
                                                   to check
 gone around her scraps
  
 there was the blood commons
 get their poetry please
 blackness.
  
 until long and heaven
from her firewood, and hooks
  
 the flames of person
      a dog-apollo. 
               the belting bird
                v lousy delda ,
 across the sea webs above me

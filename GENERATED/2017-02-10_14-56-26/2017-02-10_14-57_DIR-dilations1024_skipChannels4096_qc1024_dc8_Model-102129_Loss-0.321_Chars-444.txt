 LIKE A HAND ON MY FACE, SENDING,


 the new york lived to frontispie no.
 i guess when my comping at the slaughter
humming all congressed in the squirrels
in my own lifting the way to waking us--
                  no house--and stagion 
         oh, she came within my world &
                      & verdant black. whappiness 

with a go the theater with her feet cavem
 and we thirst i ne're forsaking up on dawn drill stanza schothesis,
 a sed

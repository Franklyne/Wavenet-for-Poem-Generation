       WHERE LIVING FOR NIGHT,


 i can't be no ache at best.

then my love with the wet dared wans
 for never saying
 you look along thickered after the sun.


when i go hawk except whole i begone.
 who was either said 
switch of its removal the distance.


rather the floors of all my synthesi,
    banging inwards of us in her tender
 chaos and night meet you more work
  
 like the end of death in youth me
 has a territation margarines and do

 THINGS


 grasping around.  false to read.

it's all be read the feathers of loves that dark
to a warm for lying daintily spells
 and nuzzle the barn. but in me.
like a better now shapely regular evil
enters, at a temple of steel things
then sometimes we still beneath or asleep.

the stones never women on the streets 
the nose the sheet & read the tip mad.
 the grave that plainted to rhyme
 over themselves in the seasick as
east the old strat

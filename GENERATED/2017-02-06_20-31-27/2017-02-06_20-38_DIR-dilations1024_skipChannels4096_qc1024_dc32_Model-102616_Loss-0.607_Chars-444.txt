 WITH THEIR LAND OUT OF HIS DWELLING


alive on a sudden skin, 
the soil blank skin, beneath the mink that island

she tells her words it's too late 
of place you wheels possible to destroy
what a good plastic bags
slipped
on a caff 
fashion takes of tassaw, the children's revenge.
where they don't know.


is there a voice a bed of care i breath
image sap as the cut cutation and gay

such as we give my sun spyll of romances
it's floor. wordles

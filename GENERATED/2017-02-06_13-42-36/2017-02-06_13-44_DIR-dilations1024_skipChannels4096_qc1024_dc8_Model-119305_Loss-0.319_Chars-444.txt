 A GROTES NAVE DREAMS AND ESTRANGED IN THE TONGUES 


spiral fur long michael to a potatoes. isn't it like's fear

seepensura & caress to the line

so that fast under the hurt is tames
i am the cities of life, holding bands, 
like abrade here,
drop
till water folks i

even desert was dwindling
it had been a fist is flew
 coming off at second the whole houses,
and the clocks minions, jubilant.

a rabbit of fog,
irsseiving change that beats,

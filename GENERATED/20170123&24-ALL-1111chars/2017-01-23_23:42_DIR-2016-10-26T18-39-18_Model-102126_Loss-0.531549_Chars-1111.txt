 HATE, LEAVING A ROOM


 and hollow birthday on our cannibalists
 the world herebyre that kindle, said the roiling white.
and of his fathers that i do soften.
the rod is less. he says, fashioned by the ocean
clockwork i saw a battle of hats a fetish 
for saved past last clutch its defend horse 
i find its wallas of the agreed branches the baby.
 somewhere the names are in terror chattered harmless
becomes a like, reflected by our feet.
today i could see  and watchme that years
that samws seeking the amalmes marches
the forest is stiffing out through what wise and chaper-dollars,

they'll carry water-cutting my furnace that was i was rain tread
 bowed against the wave.
  
 and the boys and doors from ice, 
and let your ankle. it's a crossing 
seldom noon wear the felony alive--

like no more full of the photos where my lining railroad up.
 
i want to be a magpie &
let's trying whisper i am little like the tongue

of all there's no into the words of eve 
 a piccadilly, not out the photograph is sotto,
deliberately watched her hand these long green fades sung.


mistook his crescent, the being moment

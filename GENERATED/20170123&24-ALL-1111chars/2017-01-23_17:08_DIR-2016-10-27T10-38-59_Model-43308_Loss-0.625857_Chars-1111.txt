the canvas at onter, roaring or 
to object deadman winter's way   
dragged the mind,

they have made shone the never bed,   
an airy home & men are the gustered air   
weather-waiting a bore 
sooty snake blue of a poem

and hideous unmannequin among the arm of

as eve, a mirror 

the sound a simpler very slope of shine   
makeshift intention, 
startles iw? all.

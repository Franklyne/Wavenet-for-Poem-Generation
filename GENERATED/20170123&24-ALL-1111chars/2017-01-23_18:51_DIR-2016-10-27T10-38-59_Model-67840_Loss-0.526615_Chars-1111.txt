 UNIVERSE.


 a temperate jage, as if convalescence
wax tekens i kissing again--
almost atmospheres on our hands climbing
 of another my body into the word he con me
en faxtan smile involvements donkeys, heaving on
 another line. yet we keep us goods.
 i put a tsper-mouth cause,
 bird's off. in doorways, not vacati,
 only to me in the war. we give thoughts,
 that i was clearboard, the fire country
 behind the afford through the wind

as if too much 
when it is 

heavenly memorized in between
 to a coin cling beggar.  ailed,
 
opening like lost street
in threesin i was misplace.
  
 no longer t-shirtet need--

ah, just drifting me, so voisy,
bare voices she her young.   
this is the constant flour tree.
the drag your eyes or dozens
 that paintings, with fate,
the hospitals were midnight in the spine
  
 when the sun remembering a life--
 two nesthus
                                                                                                                            dream?

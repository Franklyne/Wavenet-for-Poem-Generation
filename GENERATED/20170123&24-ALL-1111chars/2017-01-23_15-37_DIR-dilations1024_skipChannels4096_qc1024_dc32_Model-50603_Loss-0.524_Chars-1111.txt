 sam produced his spiral life zibs of feet unbending 
 when through the dark turn of whale,
                                                                           weird--
                                                  everything you intoned.
  
 and i wrote my friendly lyrics--strome
 under the moon and might tense, giggled in.'
            the had a levered rolls out
                                                              and cover.

against the segment who didn't wash
                              here in mike's mouth

                       starts the hyacing,
 slams of beavers me straps in ottawa.
                                              kind,
                                      and take
                                             as for a restlessness.
they blurted a lipstick.
  
                                                   
                                         it the droop

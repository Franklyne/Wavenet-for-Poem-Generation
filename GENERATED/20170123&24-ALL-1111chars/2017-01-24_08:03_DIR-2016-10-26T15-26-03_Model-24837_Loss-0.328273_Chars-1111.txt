      A MIND TO AND THE WOODS


             bracelets ran on my skin,
        camon passive colors and mullause.
                                after boybed
  
 search of washington to the bible in
                                        marmless,
      and holding trjace-dark
                                   but if my slumberinas,
                                                 
                             people mammaters.
  
                    and tongue the eyes,
                                  no longer
             and the dewdonness, rumored
       through the mine will be gratual
  
 
                    the film of every old,
                          have young is
                          and wet, then him
                              a trash has paints
     the high fence is her mettles,
                  and now you unfeign when.
  
 all of us breething still trumpeter,
                                  to whispern-squinto by signs
                                      venative

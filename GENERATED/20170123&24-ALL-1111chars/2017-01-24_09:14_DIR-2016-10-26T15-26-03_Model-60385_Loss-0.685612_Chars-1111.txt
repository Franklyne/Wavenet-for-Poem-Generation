 OF HER BLOUSE,


clear years ago, 

small, among the crimes and cold, with   
your kitchens blink blindfly, 
the lincoln lung, the mantle i met him out 
relation sideways, over languages 

to water nor within dimpled blazer, 
but nettles on your liberty 
and mistresses   
breaking that lived her soul.


i saw you will swadled down 
with un-eardrrime 
than that even himself 
of mind to the ordy between men   
my bass and argue 

in all this is the way i's cry. 

her thirsting 

the white vandied widens   
at the rivers, 

tree, cold her a look 
in water to follow the mist.

how got vain time i fold in my heart leap.

it made noise           the one   
i by the history of my prelude   and came out time-size    with the crowd 
you the build. then the man is near.


his speed to light raise 
and heavy sun left. 

the germs of sawgrass blow.

but i no matter     wants falls away, 

the field, arms still, 

during the ground triolity. 

through a table 
beyond its half 

there are made tearing in the quinces of light've 

panve a single lives, 

through antlers, at the farm 
as blackness of light 

go

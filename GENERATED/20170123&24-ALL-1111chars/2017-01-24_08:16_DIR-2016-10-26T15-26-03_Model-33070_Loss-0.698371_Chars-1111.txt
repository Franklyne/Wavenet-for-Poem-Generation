--who were a rose for things now, the porch
and lately expressing to what you have for,
i cannot fall for love, a sound of flowers
a face. it is it up from the shiny 
thens we had happened, orac-legs  gone knives--

hand covered without all that happen.


          

i remember's awe

low and haven't--silences like the path 
to god
on the beam's bark 
the world is a crown. 
and, made toward us--
--it blind. there will always
 
choose, desire  mirrors 
and for light behind this simple.
it is a poet, floru
to the freepathy of the words.
  
                        city shamed out thene.
                                       he
 drenches for my long reading skin,
but i know only see, and place

come resting from fights measure
made lightning to a prince, all snoring, 
i had my book is a typhoon sky
love, light she will fight against

discovers and pots sail with only because

 ON THE DARKNESS DOWN ...


 to find is shouldn't look like tender has so word,   
 has a trumpeter who's thimble, and i do
a fluff-backed the people's green palaces
 as a beer the kyrr of a moo-beam or a future might bottle.
  
 changer dancing celebrations the prospect
 no grass out in your great and as the waste
your english wait so my rain.
the wind was for fashioned i can steady glaze of cup
removed upon a kind of my mouth that day
falls like a baseball rarely the pillow world
inside, my chooses. i had been my warm
 while over the world down a cell   
is unseen for dying flies in the time
bleeding sign of her lips of the pause.

but with dust an april a convergal,

grenade sweet and wet, may no longer 
is appropriate all of us to me, 
needs let's nothing remote 
 no longer onebinger of fever went for this had happening 

between us nineteen no longer at dusk. 

the day like guest. we wish i tried
 draughts and banners discharging
 a map, watching instants,

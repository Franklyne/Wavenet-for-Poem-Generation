 I STOOD OF EX-BREATH, HISTORIES OF THE FENCE.



 i await their weekends. she thoughts sky,
 or sharpening all unlithoritu's neighbor hate.


bright was a hummingbirds form
for that i-love watch caves our lips            
  
 i die, bliss face a blood outside
  
                                     
and hide given 
                                                                   class

                                                                                                                               now?

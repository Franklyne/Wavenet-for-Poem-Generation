 HANG AGAINST THY FATE 


till and despair of delay. 
                                                         
the green connect and beauty de no 
                                                                                 an end 
o sang unites of his plaid, 
fail 
          it's not remain o' all abodes, 
      why dwell on, and leap troubled 
                                                          on the fritiles? 

                and their primal says should go 

                              run on the pictures, 
                                                       and steps delia's velvet arrayed 
in me she look on blunt thee and south pillow      when he conquer the livelong cloud, 
         in those lines simple flowers and protest slop down, 
her eyes of the departed night bacchus vivid studying o'er, 
that you read manufactured seen, the fallen skies 
      then that the turn of mountains our are cheer,
 i have died, from her clasp book down thy sot 
great music time that they're which of my ear.
knock, provoke he him. he pleasures in well.

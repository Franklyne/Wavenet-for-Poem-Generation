 and shoot holy into masked knives
 low holy the rainbow
 three they don't met the collective
 in circles  it when
 blurry to the sidewalks
 and murmur of
  
  
           jasmine
  
  
  
  
  
 disappear in the lamb?
 in the motion is
 a photographs, helicopter
 he sees the wind
 could sit listen.
 i don't stand my face idiot inside.
  
 i'm always laugh, with a room
 proclaim with a picture pored
 they don't listen to drop.
 damagedta shirt up in madly circles
 and the manna and on paint
 form brothers
 a land

                             in turbans,
and all of it
                 at the caps drop,
 inside me.                      night, 
                     holy

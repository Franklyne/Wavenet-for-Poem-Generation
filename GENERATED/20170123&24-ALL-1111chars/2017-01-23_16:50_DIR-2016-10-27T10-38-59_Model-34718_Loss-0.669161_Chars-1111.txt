burning to here and tauped and laminated her   
breathing to learn owe none eve 
the friend in painted miless and faded heats   
our eland day, and burned--wa lit sweet.   
do de pictures limp now won? ever walk on   
on perhaps--the child over clenched, irresist 
halls 

lions will soon,   gain of cool solicit tranqu've   
& you believed in a riveteenth away, and now translations ago,   
pollen night, as wakened it, locked on chance-- 
then an orker i can't be worth bends back

i limede wasbeor's mouth dream 
striding at your mind, it was industry

in pubis of gravel--yeat lead

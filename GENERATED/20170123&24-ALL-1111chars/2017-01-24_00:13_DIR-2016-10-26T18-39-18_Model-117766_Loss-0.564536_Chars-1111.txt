 LAMPLE, THEIR MASS SAY


the equator prepare falls new york
that dignify more tude hand
outside the poets and bring
and a psychiatrist
maintains yourself, like turquointed 
the stubborned me now seems
he meeting out 
sun bend
i explanation,
a verb of touch
the warly seems time
is now.
i'm suffocate 
a rare and flowers
to meir passer
it would not she is finished with
like the darkness is
trails perpetuating out his pickup
make an aspect a proper jail.
but the landscape 
our trunk hidden brushed up the sun,

while they drift of going in abyss
fossiled by excuse chaos
this poem my little dog the light 
nor the troubles fruit moles
your seven worker
no
be won, walk our day,
trail iron cronking
out of evening stick

in the angry of feet,

by bones they have my chains and degree,
gather never does not sticks
you are foam coming

there is nimble lingers, taut rough

or the scrub who seek.
i've arriving stacked the bad for the grave i smoke
even summer even one matter wrenches,
mothers wide the wind,
lying as cultures or cheap and may wei both
let's stand evening,
to blinka-line what save sent into women

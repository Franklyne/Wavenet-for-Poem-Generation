 I SAW HORNS AND SAD,


      the face fist faces, in the slip of the jeff-string
  
 walks handle to tears into the corner's clover
 sat the stumble and stories make it thrall
 from jibe-sorrows of berlin gates of sand
 
though this is an angel inside the tender tomorrow.
  
i receive avernised understand.
and something like plastic shouted on the shroud
 heap, delected out the perfect wave of the road,
 the computers . . .
surely answer eart

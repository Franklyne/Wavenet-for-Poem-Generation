 MY TONGUE WITH THEATER.


  
 so wrought on and un- a
 cloud moist aside your voices tightfish.

how the hummingbird variation
 and listening juice of one but unmarred
heaven, absence and imprison lets bench

in adversity to outy the wood they ripe 
of wind when i love is
 a white turns on the most finger brow
 reception's sake. the brazen gates of a snig
 of two what you may seen
that with a small can can in the sky mindful,
you clocks down

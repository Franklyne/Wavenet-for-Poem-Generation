 THE TENTATIVE BENCH.


  
 his boundary poet who smile the faces.
  
 his love in teardrops.
 i saw you our short and lanterns here proudly, 
 i saw her shared at.
  
 and on the highway come--of these of its self-depression
 to celebrate sheets, clean plant
 of the trees, another. giving is dead and dazed.
 the woman of the more i grope your plus. dreams happy lost does.
 miscatic, to lace the picture
 out of the bathroom of the white smokin

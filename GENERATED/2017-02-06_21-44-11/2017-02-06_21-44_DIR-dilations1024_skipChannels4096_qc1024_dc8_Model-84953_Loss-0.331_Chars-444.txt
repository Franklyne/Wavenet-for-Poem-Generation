 NIGHTS


 blots in the stars of the newfile house
 amongst pastle in the fingering fate, 
till i can come out of it is on our room,
 i used to shorest, angels unloose,
you can make mattress. those yes of long,
  
 my mother walk of a fine lives
              apple--he-lion am from all that i dressed
like bow of ancient, reluctant high schom
 and see my mouth milk lustils.
headed your secrecomes a sigh, t-tourist
 dens are more for the horizon

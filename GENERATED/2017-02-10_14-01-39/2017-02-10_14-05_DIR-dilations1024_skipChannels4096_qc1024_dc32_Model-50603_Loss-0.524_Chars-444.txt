 BUT OON





my mother, erides we don't meet again 
so don't know a task. and therefore

where she saw at first, yes.  young and scientistuous
and after all that's voiled leaflet 

belts of sock fur gantrus and ghance

of river's 
falling slap of moths

                 the rain desert.
 i would take if her beloved-o'-wheeled was dry.
winter the world was durable 
dining drenched on the amber of a stop and weeks

your fathers stood parts

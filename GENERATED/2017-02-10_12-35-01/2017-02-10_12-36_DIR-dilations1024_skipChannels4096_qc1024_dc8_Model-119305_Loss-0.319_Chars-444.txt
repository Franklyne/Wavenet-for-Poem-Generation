 MY BLOWS, AND BEST 


 never but feeling breeze twins tossed and sacked and fuse folk.
 nothing waiting the loom and hunger and of the paradise, i'm said
as the nineteenth caramel, stubbled in small sky.
the jasmines of a lover chafdeuins seems to the heat

a master a set in the ice day is red hole
 rebound out the common ghost of my walk.
for the soul to have been in the thornside of oppress
his ruitress, clerites its gloss.
 freud state me

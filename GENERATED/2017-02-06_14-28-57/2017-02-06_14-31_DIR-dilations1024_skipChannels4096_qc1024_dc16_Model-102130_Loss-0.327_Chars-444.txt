 ME S ALSO WAS NOT YET PUSHED UP MY CENTER OF PLAYTING OUT THE TINTED TRAIN. THE NEXT REVERY, ABOVE THE WORLD, A KIND OF MY TASK GUM.


				

 

in a cave some suffering air tasks.
  
  
 speak to the trans.
 is wearing on hertick off men
 the crushing breathing below
 wisps like jepan toward the job.

now i go to the vaje house and passure.
 on the roadside.
is the child kinks of winter

a desert and jolds turn in our view.

the herehean past

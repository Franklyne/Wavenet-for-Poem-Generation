 EVERY DAY WOUNDED



the main leaves it like bushes on a road
 there are many a cheeks. he settle here
  
 lying fans cyclopcola.


if i would be a corvalescence

the dust street it, awi
  
 a more of them back,
 on high a new man rescue
 
landward the caves all sun.
 you must all this mark yourself,
 avenger and body heavy,
 back when we figures dream the chariot of your eye

i don't never came in the river.
if it were tahite nap
 then cling

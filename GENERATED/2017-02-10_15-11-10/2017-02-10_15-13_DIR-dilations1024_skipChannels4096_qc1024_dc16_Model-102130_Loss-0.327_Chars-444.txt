 THE CITIES


 at the long mask to a wound on the skies
 the white roof-gnaw, my gardens must be
 boring the sky, and then yourself--
 july. then estate architects--each
 a thousand planet baby no more teo--
i am not hear the commotion and toy.
 the mind thirsts
 of marathon memory of the throng
from a thorn to give you
and fee
 what i will spill 
that bales
that possible
 blacks
 of our life and tray. 

 at the hunt
lowered into soul singing

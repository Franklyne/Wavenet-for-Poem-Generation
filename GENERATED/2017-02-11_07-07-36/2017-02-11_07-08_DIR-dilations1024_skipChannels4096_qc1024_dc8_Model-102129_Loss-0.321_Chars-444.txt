 I'D LIKE THE RAT SET SIDE. 


 do not at the clouds of the massive 

let me muttering 
          in turns on my tongues
 in the nepeam sea robberry in dryads are weakened off vest.
 where my friends and wound divers.
  
 the red prisoners of coming amends,
later healed on the portal  with
 and dawns the face of gods and roasting
 and said into the saucer--dark fur?
 and his tattered, seeing in ocean-street
i see them it's to come i searchers

 THE GOBLIN OF EACH,


 social poems, at banquet. on a pool sperip
the stars shine curve of mankind stars.
means destinies' 

stop
  
  
 au african & being the beeders and yawns.
 i saw his thing in the tubanoon might lead
 the thinner wounded in a blooms jazz?
 is through filling heaven is grasp mode,
slayed in a doorway, hold   
awako boat of the half-arms boy weep
 the hooked all lovely, unsilence my wife
 watched me earth full of the rose

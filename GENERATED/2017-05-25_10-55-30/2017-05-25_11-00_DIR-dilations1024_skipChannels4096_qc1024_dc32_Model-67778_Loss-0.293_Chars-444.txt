 OUTHENTIC STITCHED


 doesn't changed an open poor still softens
  
 oh the ants the wood exhaled room, twisted like storage and kissed hand
 appointed like ends with blood,
 entangled in vertical face to couch our minds.
  
 a dare made in the old woeful sacks &
  
 take the cucioaris believes in feathers,
 i am alone the book of that counts,
 dair brave made spanish atonians growing await,
 cab americable some of the fire, unsythenizer.

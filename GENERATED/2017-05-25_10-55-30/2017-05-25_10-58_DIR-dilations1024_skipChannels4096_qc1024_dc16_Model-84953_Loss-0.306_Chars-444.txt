 AND FREE WANTS TO THE HORIZON


cast track to bed the moment in the harbor's lukewarm walk
 and an inevitable, and i heard faces with birds
 and sea kdies of corpse-daughter of eachelorip straps of sputting
for long i look at efergette in drenches of sun,
 breathing otto smoked fingers he first of thee,
 caves and be confidentials turning out of ocean,
 whom i long for this name iwes and space the one
 brooks and little one blanket and zybicd

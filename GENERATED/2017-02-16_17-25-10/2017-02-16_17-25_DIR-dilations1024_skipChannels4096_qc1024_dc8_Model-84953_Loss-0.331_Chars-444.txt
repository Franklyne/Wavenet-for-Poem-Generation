 SOMETHING IN PICTURE,


    for it can bats her dinner frontiers
 the hour of town midn of mirror, slag and falling up from was three
 against, flat is turned a wall of my lases 
creeps the thieveth night's wilt ships of hell 
basalt fights her portrait bof with their prize like suices
 their hearts the seas gutteringbitves
their porled buponah pine there were after taste
 should i feared at the wall and from o mind 
to my parasol me span. i

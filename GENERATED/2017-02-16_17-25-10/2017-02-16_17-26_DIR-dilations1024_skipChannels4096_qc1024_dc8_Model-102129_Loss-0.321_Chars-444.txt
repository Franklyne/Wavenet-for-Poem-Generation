 STANDING SYNAGOGUE


 to pass that arm, her black eyes
 it legation national freedoms, i put sea being home,
 and the needles, kiflimitous warming. 
if swinging outside 
for a whisper loud the ocul-poety passed. i search
 reminds the subway to the ends of wind this blank
 coin of the city atox and i drop out,
panic
and toilet mologed as i squint
new foatre faces--ortado past.
the actors rope, shaking down in this before on the shelf. 
plaster

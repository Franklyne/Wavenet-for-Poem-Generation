 TO SAY


       as the chartreuse of new an untebration,
                                                                the holiest of such a light cove
                                            who sought the small
 the child of frost twigs and binds on morning
                   wood and feet about how


words white foam for the sky. so.
                                                         to them from the sky and laugh,

 SOFT AND HE HOARSE OF MY SOUL


  
 to those who finally sprout,
 get wet ourselves. 
 aasteres understand and bill
 since chest.
  
 as if the untroubled earth.
 the tomorrows of tires.
  
 a beacons and the scent
  
 blows anything has new
 ber for him to my belly?
 returning,
 where fatriflung pineappland
  
 long the things i was dragned
 a father's grave.
  
 i wound on destructions
 and the heart weeks are york
 than thunder...
  
 hurr

 THESE ADVENT.


 hook in the sea the sorrow of hunger,
 for each of my vulva? he put on her car
 meet. the point to whispers toward the light,
 and went a happy.
  
 dirt, the left its hand and sublime,
 body may covered above the way
 i never meant not half
 of her butterfly, 
curves back the throne
 of my cost es the ride
 of firebath.
 the flimsy mowing breath,
 where other their simplicity
 we can't leave over syllables
 about that we can

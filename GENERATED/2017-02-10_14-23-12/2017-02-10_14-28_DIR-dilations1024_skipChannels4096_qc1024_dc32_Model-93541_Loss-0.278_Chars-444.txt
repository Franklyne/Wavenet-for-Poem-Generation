 ME


 how are from our myth of lips,
turn outlaw and dreamy of this 
lavender, heavy we would wear
down the baby's lace.
the june through st. martin, with skin,
from sumptuous fleshining path
and surfaced sidewalk,
seven frets to its own heart.

why are protectory flares
let's mostly stands, and so can
touching able antique
and at my mouth
the upturns orbiting a complex,
piled water. and take
between the docks swirl

her gregory beards
kenele

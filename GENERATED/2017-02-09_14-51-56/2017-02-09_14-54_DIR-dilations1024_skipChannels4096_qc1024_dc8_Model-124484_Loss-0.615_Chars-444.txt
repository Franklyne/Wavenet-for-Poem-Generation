 THAT MELODING 


in your back his bosses the garden. 

the emptiness. 
he dives and how you go, 
this utch i found. 

you have to be was, 
at the new length. 
ate there in candle--the old & death blood to think 
of those who the broken quickirt, 

the streets. none of us 
tasteth mines and which does thinking 
lights, make up dismember had gone up my boots 

that you had no way   paralyzio. 

ding, i hear the far was else?

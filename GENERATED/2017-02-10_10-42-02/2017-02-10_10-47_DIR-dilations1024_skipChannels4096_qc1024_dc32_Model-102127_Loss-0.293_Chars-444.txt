 GRAVEL SHEER


 better spare letters freeze dines
 whispering the dead to make me
those who blow no moonlight 
 once the feasted brothers 
 and think sunday strike rust
 dim arabicant for sand 
 goodbye. we stalk among the grassy by men,
 but his habit for his shoes, 
 no one can make you when she laughs
 that here, in the spars, whose deserves
 better than a battlefiendis strangers flapping,
 and un-ordering intentions, speak even as the sky

 FEMALE MACHINE SAILS


 the rain table and hard for the very minds by,
how did i was filled be on them, in fighting

and said heat out to be kind of drinks 
is for the door was a blood, you are
the universe. the size and bolt-cue,

hiding the house,
like the subject waterspout and shot.

and my wrists, white-slaves and sea
where i know that i wrote ye writes--
on the yar

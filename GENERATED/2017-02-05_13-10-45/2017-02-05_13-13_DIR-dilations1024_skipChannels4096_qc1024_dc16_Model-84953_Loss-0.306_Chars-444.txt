                               not my body i saw the south,

                                                                           base of the prairie-nuer, 
and maidens in these rooms in a sister over our in the toileteras rope of the drool
  
  
 constructed boots. we're not oats we heard the crater's tomb
     i hold you get not crotch grimes on cheek
                        bathing of beetley of ochet

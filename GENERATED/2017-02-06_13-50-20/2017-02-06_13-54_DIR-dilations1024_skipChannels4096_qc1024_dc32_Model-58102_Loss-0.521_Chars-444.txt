 IN THE HOLY GHOST YEARS AFTER


 mounting posed in a sombre floated 
 these, stage who left in minneaph
  
 that flapping heat for the enemy of my thighs
 smiling into a hand on the faces
  
  
 the love in one who left the holes
 to energy ingredient in hell grin
 to valiuming the color begins to the air.
 like the granes with a painbow increased
 there waiting fortunes caliban

 the bane is beyond the aroma tile ...

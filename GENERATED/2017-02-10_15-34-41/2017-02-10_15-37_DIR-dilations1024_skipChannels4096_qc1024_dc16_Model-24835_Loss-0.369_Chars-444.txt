 SECRET BAND AS A ROBINSON


 as a deliberator we rubber and heavy,
when rocks . . . my troubl's plot too fast-board
 us times were never and burrowing
 the swart sighslavipine glare, reciprocally

by the bole world gyms, pregnant
and sloth our breast of thinking she flight.


why can tell me by here and forlorn the shifts.
blaets fixed with food asia flame like a square
 and feel your dreaming comes the window 
for patterns were welcome them

 AS A TAIL THERE I BARE THE SOUND DROWNING AND PAUL,


      sat i am the thunderclaps everyone mankind
 such wedding like hairs of the great hand
                  the burning back into quick revolution
  
 set my father still and the flame
 the way before platformites i bend in his nerves of your ash, 
a matter is flapping sexed socks, wildly defgained to introduction a titer.


no patience hat
  
 still masque sae and bound
  
 for freedoms

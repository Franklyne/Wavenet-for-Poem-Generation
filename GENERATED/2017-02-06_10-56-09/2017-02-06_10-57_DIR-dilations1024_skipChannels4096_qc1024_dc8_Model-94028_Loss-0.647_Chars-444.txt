 ITS TATTOOS, RUNNING TO HIS VICTORY


journeyes comings on whitters and very glass of men,
the pills into the present was moving sleepy 
of those who runs on other happened.

satire is nails, serves, impeccable from binary cut.
pretty lives and a bedroom i think smolder that 
finds never tar. i listen

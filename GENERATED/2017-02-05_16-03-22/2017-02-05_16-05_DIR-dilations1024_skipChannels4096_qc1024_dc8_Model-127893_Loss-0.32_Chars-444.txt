 THE SUCKED WE ARE,


and i search again flock of nails vanish to the funeral house
 the shout perestrots and ochre is the sun,
at no use uno sequel
 just the whole strange.


hover mile from guards look words
got tight a fields,
    doss man stops
  
 your destination,
'tis nothing and the slogan
 and not the boughs are lost
  
 its substance gotten. ourselves
 who bequeathed on the bond
ivyscent, sat in the morning gouge
  
 dings up merely

 BOREDOM,


 there is always
  
  
 holy thought score over--his doing
 truck times no one hearse
 stares too sheep
 bound to keep inside--
its holy through the floor
 gives you, who falters

like fast & feet pistol, prized wires.
 made evenings, frozen--

  
  
 as we hold to family each time to miss
  
 mountain his return tree,
 here, he'd down a knife-step,
 gave the can i the desert its specers,
  
 falllay is enough, like a honker lands

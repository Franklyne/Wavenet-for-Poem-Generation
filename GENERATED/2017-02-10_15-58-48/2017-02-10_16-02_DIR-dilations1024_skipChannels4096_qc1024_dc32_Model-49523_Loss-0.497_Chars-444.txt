 MACHINERY, NAY-WRITTEN


 desire each woods again in the dream
 i alone
 no stout you
 lapped
                                          there is our brain


an agetic, nothing to do with us by
  
                 with your f'd in the lake audible holy
 agape, she though the bridges would be roots angel
                                                                to you, before it is like

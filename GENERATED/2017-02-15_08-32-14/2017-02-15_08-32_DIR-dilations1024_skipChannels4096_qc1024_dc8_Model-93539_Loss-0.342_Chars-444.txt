 ME AGAIN,


 stair sew.

the sliced circle of time, i might have in the war,
 and the whole rose, to a targille 
had a salt and look at sentries
 the one lean on the furze
 when i said that is a tangling

 we're through a roll in the water.
the air is perception. there
 north so sweet, the borea-kought through breath, 

to the brown with the chairs.
  
 the bondsance like the light, there is stun
 the negro days loses of poverties true?

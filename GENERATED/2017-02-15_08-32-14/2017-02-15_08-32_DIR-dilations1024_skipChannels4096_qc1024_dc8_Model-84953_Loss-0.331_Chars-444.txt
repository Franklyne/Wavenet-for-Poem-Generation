 MADE


 the crowds swings. in mimesis
 the hero treadstones as christ was glee
in the dark how fine cries our knees
 the bed of virtue wheelchair makes
 on itself upstrings left in lack jehoving.
 i stand up the world above,
only climbed you have a worm then
 of a book i want to see them
 was cloud-tracles on the sound
gathered in my famous the coda.
and you're not my ink in the sky, wrapped
me 
that there is how i dreamed the storm.

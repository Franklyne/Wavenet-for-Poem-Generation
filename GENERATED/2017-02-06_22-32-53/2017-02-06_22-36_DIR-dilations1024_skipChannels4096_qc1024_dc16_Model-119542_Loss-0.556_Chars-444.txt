 LESS THAN THE SUNDAY


    feel asters dissolving,
          memorizing his hand considers,
    white collar ball with whom i flood,
             pillow, ce. this is nothing the pale
              wholly face 
      i chose them can cruise it.
      i hear her life. when it is
       blood on the walls.
            wood scab.
       planned. call white as naunt day
    sinclairs they shave it
               why not in the journey of our name,

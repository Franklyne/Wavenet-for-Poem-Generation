 ON FOOD, 


imagine the hills don't ever seen
                                       pitter stones
            it's is spring their eries
 constantly slumped evenings sprout.
the finished kids on any tiny sandle-


no, the dream great world mr,
  
 their turn my suitcases his half tas
 i must sunny and chickens bar 
madder polo 
             to women and bloody. sluice,
torture of tapid weighed milestial column coin,
      and the good beacon

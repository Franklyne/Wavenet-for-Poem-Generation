 ON THEIR TIME


never see you love turned it, when i wanted
whispering away and your hair the fubits dramas,
soon enomatos withering longing birds and bag, wouldn't deny
o, lovely in the boats, the duke of the stars 
begin this poem fill such unnoticed,
a week and took that.
its bloody crawled looking for birds on a dumb
enemies had to fold hitting

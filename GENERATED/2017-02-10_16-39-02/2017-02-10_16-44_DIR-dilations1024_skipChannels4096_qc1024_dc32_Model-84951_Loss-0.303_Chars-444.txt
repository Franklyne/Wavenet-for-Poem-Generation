 IS SOME DARE.


 you can't keep us seized
 to degree down upon cliffs bust,
 he never tires. near another life
  
 sons of petricate clouds of unoppontent.
 the prize for veins fortunes 
 and laughed out of the hard-er
 a pendulum of the date path.
 let it tip, after the almen lung.
 in the coast the shadow of me
 the firefly i ask how small.
 the contours come from rings without.
  
 and it is not sick, man and shadow,
 soft were at the back

 THE CLOUDS ON A CONGENITA.


    dilatonizing, insatiating here.  i can almost 
 but it's the sky popping by central
   it was like, with no blushes & along the city
    thingful to obliterate, far from the last real
'bits of us that man bastioned it his room 
and east
     this stony is colonizing a copious thing
   and unfaine dark
 saccoons, though here
     the ship brown.


'tis better cafe.
        know it was given thought,
        chl

 THE PARKING LIKE A RIVER,


the night i came to the air its feet?

the tears so gentle halfdouses, turning the largest but my comrades.

                                             beside across the necklace waste
                                                                            but my old land on fire
                                     perhaps in a series are behind
                           the rest of linny poured on the drop

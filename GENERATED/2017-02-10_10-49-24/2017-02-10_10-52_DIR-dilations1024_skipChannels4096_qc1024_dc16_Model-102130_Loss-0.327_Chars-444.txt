 AFTER SOMETHING OR A SINGLE TREE


 my whole? something rights pink makes poken
shedding with the inner breath & lost.
 a stick of person tonside ado fading the st.
  
 a choir in a poem i go in the rights
 in each matters lost and forced to spare
 will form and heaven over the more again.
we murmured from fill the sunrise. from
is salt the self i think, and then i had
my trade and blank and primed over by
 we've heard through which are tired

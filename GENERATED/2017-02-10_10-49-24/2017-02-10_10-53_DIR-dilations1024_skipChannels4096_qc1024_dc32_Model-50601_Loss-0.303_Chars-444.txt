 IN MY OWN--



the man is one had torn and alongsimo.
these tencies, i think it is
always take the source
towards us there's shears 

civilized. caught
beneath a crowded clouds pocket knew i'd hounded 
in the pool canopy he knows that song of my head
burst a court ponding how to take the face.
but it's on the grillwood of the sea.
from sleep summer was there her freedom

on sand. i was the instant with horn,
to try to do, no, it is time still

 HIS OWN MUSIC


       in all that anecdotes by dew-throng up a sight 
    things burying on a cause. 
       i dead come or damned where the house was reading-- 
      
      all the bulliciding statue or little left you   
      i went out idle this loving lies gut, 
                                        measure, love's little blubber 
                  our conscience make a mirror anthill. 


   and made weary, that requires me and seas,

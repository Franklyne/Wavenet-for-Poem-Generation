 THE VOLVO, AND THE WILL WAS WHITE MAN,


when the authors tins pictures who took me
 judges her heart across the shullpa,
 to whose men
in the teeth. the heart of my time it is not.
i once step on nothing more or tradegrad? each
 in taste sparrow our backyard,
  
  
             her tiny hard me i go,
 summer in the west, walks on the fall
 the loving heat of the story,
  
 it would be the end
  
 of another mine, precarious throats
     some

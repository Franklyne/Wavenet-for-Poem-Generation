dry by in bed of my thigh slide of its men. 

how much of lean on white faith in the bed   
with   weave, we'd have find heart 
in a poem. you've labored   
return in suitable bags by hung   
once empty gallon the stores of white color play? 
it may sinks and i hate of all wet the love it 
the plattened voice afternoon, 
staring the few years feelers close to take, 

trying in a warm, you have a fool ominence. 

i read the book. i smiles above my life's   
without hatcheistrush and the ruff. 

              down to her job will soon 
       ah                          and spilling through and scotch-blade,   
and take out there. 
         inside more were exhausted   
                     one hand something, waiting in             passion, and skillets are waiting

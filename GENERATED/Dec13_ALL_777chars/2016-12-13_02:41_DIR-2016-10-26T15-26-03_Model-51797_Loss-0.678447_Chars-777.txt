of past, then dead waters what can i am god 
what i'd like the weeds, 

from the ridge of sleep. in the doorway   
we humanist pull it hard. 
 
it is done in their feet in the gods
where they stores coming backs 
    bitches the lightning, 
    such as if all in the tubs, 
can turn   forever hand, 
      in a field of the church 
to bars and small   
drops to leave    resist        after empery's train 

before your heart, gloves    shakes       lie them   
                   we hended shits, bones 

over the leaf 
stratum a public i heroes,

of the gray as a chair raft-out 
of my throats--high leathers    sang 
another mind, 
froducts rereniations? 

is heavy widening clue   huss, 
but watch

 SO ADDITION. WHEN


 the chalk, then as it shoutings,
  

meanwhile glass to come an artery,
 the truth man to garden,
dangerous with leaves
stood 
 antibalography was as a streets
 of my father. my cauldron, 
their hair child, and the days go round the tip,

                                            oftener laces.
  
 when it is waiting four point in the shop
           and his name the dogs holy
the burning
 where the eternity of landlocked them
 till out loud so you cover
i to the path to shrouded holy
 have the underbread.

 rave with weep,
 her fathers coming vanishing
 with their irresponsups, rain, 
 your turmeric foliage, hours
far toes was seeing peaks see.
 somewhere in love, loud
before anything.

 SPORKS,   


of knowledge it was mine tree swan   
had a park soul blue will praise   
on his heart and fear or asked fishes   
belly driving in mythic caw languid 
in a habit, cut in troubled young

crocheting down, last night someone games, 
the trice of storms still which she peers his song 
adjoincial ranges in the blossoming poet, 
now won'to comfort slight's hands of his glass-- 
mules at me strange girls out ourn in memory 
coming to us then riot last tilt on this concever hard


continues with the leopard 
light in twine-corner on fire fill 
till gray cabbagehing space a sudden   
                        they brill 
in howles lifted me 
mounded from earth's its neptum, 
and he's just since 
then lost he whispers where our rooms 
to himself meaning off a surfray

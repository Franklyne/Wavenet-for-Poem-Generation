 QUIETS IN HIS BONE.


  
 i keep me back and no dreams. deep in secret rim-
 its november, at three-visiven ply, the fashion.
 a giant the chants of abend in the wind
  
 and of perceive feel behind.

                                                fray silver penis
  
 call runs the little tresent
                        to start the yellow blooish, deared
                      she walked with jean its own

mother and all--galling of its own boys
                                                                        how mcjacke hypothers

                          the rock of seasons
 a mask tack stone aear of tears. you only
                              contained

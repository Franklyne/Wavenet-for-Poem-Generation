 MOON MINE. 



night flowers unpossible for want's secret so much 
and will i crave a foolish gewinter 
    something removal spoke, 
   the strummed sigh-ends. 



things tity their hearts enough sitting as once my beauty, 
and taste sweetly postmark devo -- since non in vain. 

   but as a baby that moulding from this left hither, 
 that dust, hung if hand thou must do well 
   in some ancient rage, 
    follower of a little dree, 
   septest to be severed in shadows? 
death but the days make wax died with realm 
   the censory concerns wait 
the cruel had denied them me sometimes. 
i'm all must confinement a thing 
the single year strut in the rain 
of junebugs not i laid
to get to be as not we feared, by strawed.
the weather turned to speed across, prickly 'n 
bruc

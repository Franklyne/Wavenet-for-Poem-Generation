 THE SPECIES


because my eyes my child haze springing
him cold now lower whispering is the temporary boots.
i dave forgot
armpics on the ruined fading her eyes
as we desperation flows half-heavy-folks mirrors
in rough the chill and lives
up to mind
the weak i feel water fool's split than window
what stone of white thrivine
i find her masturbating, your 
prince that she knows
these secret black and a bone
since he reddening into universary.
honce and hawking on bloom 

do you near my people
which the heat of machinery
short and people
late like games,
the moon
tiedings deep in miscarry

he smaller gold
march the pop of the fish at us 
innermed by address.
the next bird about dream owl.
this happy night's cariber
have a zingle of the same drawn trees amused
them has from

 ALL THEIR SPEECH


 of old phates face or
                              yet in me
 across the shades.   
 by the end,
 liquid holy praying peepost ruled
  
 so i believe is the steam, 

             balet into the arm a need to
 out of you
                           or waters, and i wear me like the light who touch we care
                                  love, field spit
                                     tores
             of metal newspling
                           it up?

the mountain green paint sensed and dark-haired deer.
                                      give beyond those 
 deafens, a child's booms
                                                                 the flying place, was head
were there, from text half-shadow
      the dog-entics go to you

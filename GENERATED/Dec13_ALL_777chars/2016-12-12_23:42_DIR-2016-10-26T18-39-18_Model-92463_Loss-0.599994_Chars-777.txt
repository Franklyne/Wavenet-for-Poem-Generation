 POETRY AS ONE.


  
 this umaga fainted and low, man is mine
stockings, and motel.

 up
firmly limit there,
 and by that one there's a worry
 legend you.
  
 to have return, warm closing
  
 in memory of a fragments
 that the holy head exact,
trading from thee together lovers.
  
 pain to find met and she, with me
 or sky another ground

all profile solitude
                          solution
 uncertain, toilet
  
         rudel, its u-liners 
                                                of the middle she high,
the eye the behemoths who laughs

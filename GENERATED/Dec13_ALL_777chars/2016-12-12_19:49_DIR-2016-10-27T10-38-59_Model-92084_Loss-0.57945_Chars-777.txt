         BITTER PEOPLE     FLEEING IN REASON AND TOTAL


unreluca & force in math across the heart
            the mind 
     

okind them quite to stone
will way mariposa     that solaces
like silent and you
too much thin 
we cross the tales and thimbs
grow, naked and sawgrass
from a body do they will you  call
the people glides, girl, hearrays it
meat of fields

whose barrio favorites
subs and kicking,
this child
somewhich stream,
howl

in the sun and i became either 
the snows shaft or shouting, 

before he the road brirland,
on the conscious rhymes from the guts
on avenue, grunt migrained
fragile escape, i say 
and i filth one shell love.


sometime determined in the south
the hours of crushed 
& eyekosable before us
passing new idea off, skin
shi  ofused it paint

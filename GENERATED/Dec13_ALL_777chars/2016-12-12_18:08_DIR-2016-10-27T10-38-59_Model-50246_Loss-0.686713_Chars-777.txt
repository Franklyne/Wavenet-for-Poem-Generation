i'm not be cards, i think
 or faith i left us all, on the strict roasted--

                              the dead in that disver, --
the others cunning in beauty 
then rings as the wound legends
 it's her friends.
it's the birches on in my conceptuousness,
which.
 without much on the cold
that she smear it, said that luncheons
and behind me your change most days.
 it is the story of the moment iiins. come say.


then only she is being

 brown & yellow and acting,
 we say it a place,
gold, how much with grey
or

not eases rest and silly space 
there look off love   
some pressure of the wind's   
for ever on to baked so 
taking out avate 
and lonely singing pigsed in my head
                 in full with numbrich
                      out freely 
                      in wort ficket beau. 

you gazed at a doll'   
             alone, sitting where

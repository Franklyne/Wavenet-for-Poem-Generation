 SHOT 


    thursday after-belt self.
 
it's midday foot freedom and we talk
 across a mist and won't crossed the hand, 
so the veil theghs that plow . . .

 today, hiding ironic enough 
edging the beauty of the blue back thoughts,
 
until it was the wheel red on the time.
  
 --are they'll be to moles at the wall, 
 might hand working off repenthe into thin
 and  moving sun or am these questionin
 on something act of her concord  
fiercely on the romans' gives out over the love
 even are well freckling, day. i mean
 bleeding between greedy laughter in the city the clerries socks
 walls out its latent, which ones are who bait

and strap, years, and a blue filted over the photograph bugs
you cock-rats.
 the feeling spring's arfle fissures, not just sing no bargain god,

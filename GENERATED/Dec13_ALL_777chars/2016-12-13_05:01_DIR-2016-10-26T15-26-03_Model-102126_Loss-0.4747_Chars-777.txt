 THE LAST.


  
                  the clear longestions 
facts upon mexico where the atmosphere,
        in the night shit up the grain
 as it dark. strange that slowly,
      quetting on the roll of paper trucks,
 though beam of someone who need a word
     striving the tensions harts.


to be our lays.

                       the moment city. i'll dance the oatan engulfing lives,
            vii
 
  
 


 on the locked tiames into the bottle i
 youngs
             a washboard or sonnettus the water.
whatever came flood in human take & there she 
eouse when she knows to feed freedom budges far is mine

spangled hair pack from the planet flame
     it's rank dress wretcheds, sheer and glass
       into knee joyous blonde, at the winter
                           

creak

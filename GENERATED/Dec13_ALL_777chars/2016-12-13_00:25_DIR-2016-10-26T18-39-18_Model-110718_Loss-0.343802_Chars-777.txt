 CLIMBING 


holding of the herum of ellio,
 poverty night at night's shovel
like a scythe trees of mirror
for dooms are so the orphans.
 ghoster and every moving by quiet of the pros mother
 next moors or another tired, white wear
  
 and cries of beauty, like forever?     for the eyes
murder the father sail the keys 
don't fall instrument, and att hook
underscorearic and the pills. he repeat towers
for three stones like the car in rough in
and with a stock of attending her cemeltons.
  
                                                                         the one that on
                                              the sea     &

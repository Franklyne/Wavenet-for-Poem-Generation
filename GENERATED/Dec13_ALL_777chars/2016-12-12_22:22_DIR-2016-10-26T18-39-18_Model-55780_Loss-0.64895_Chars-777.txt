twenty in the time of the young 
tattlinga colered between not

all that longing in the floats and song 
look back to blow or sign is love off never sending
album rotten begs and fragment illn so in   
i really raging him. 
we think i farwed the buildings choose   
and the river express one silent enough 
from the maze comeback, more 
the coming for brush garden? 
loving for both of the joyous tried and to call me breean to sighing light and how i am a misty . . . 

i was the slabs with a chain, grounds, still such, plate, you in the sporests another.


for the varnished like glass you save and that drift 
that loved 
pocking a bark on who call as supported in checkpoet.

sculpture, navyeads in a hag floor

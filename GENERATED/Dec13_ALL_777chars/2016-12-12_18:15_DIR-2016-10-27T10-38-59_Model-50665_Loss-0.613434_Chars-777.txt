 DREAMED THE SOUND OF LIFE,


 black face feels and wild of the other three 
language
 in the bug-bombs around, where disagreement fountain
 shreds the way to wind was a points of budling. 
                             i knew it weighs.
  
 and scorches and sister, mutters piece elsewhere. 
  
 trapped the headboard, she tells the only
 
     pay young, crusted freide sail, fool ones
and it would nor my navajo which the lab, 
 and white heads dropped cloud thoughts,
                      growested at the edge,
                          and then 
 cleans neglect crouched my briddle thorn-
                                                           
                                                   
                                 see high.

     WOOD THE WAY THEY CAN - IN THE OCEAN STEP-PADGES OF RAG,


 not to keep its cake from every stalks breath
  
 and lay and view, i would we want. the body,
 memory said our soul, claimed the lord economy.
 i am a man on hullows, i saw.
 cry out of a vein of the gallows
 of an ancestors that remains,
 what is the little system ignorance,
 the words for intoxication,
 unburnch of freedom holding with wintry pain, 
 and still so as a bat position
 worry to heaven, inside yourself
 and then on the enemy
 the blinded pitches of season lake
 wavement, its chest, for mona the plass
 unnamed, high--courted as a frontier jaw.
 i think of heaven's grief
 to shave been sick
 switched, day's lack lounge.
 and--abrahams, awkward plain like
 lazy hearts--as a gotten cities
 leavi

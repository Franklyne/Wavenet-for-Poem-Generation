 LIKE AT THE HALF-ANOTHER HEARING


of crumbs flash-crammed by
                  to wait acres forth holy from the golgoty
 the mallet river's shot
as laughes were as we can used to the wood
the rare you looking for all
 matter of profuses buckler's claws,
 born and in an enormous rooftop survealed
 his calmbara.  rascoove at the expensive 
  
 we are the sunset, the deserted branches the clanging car notes,
 in a coppact for all water.
                                        the air-hunting face. or everyone
 the eyes luttered to the wheresoe's crossroads in the desert,
  
 the headline on the fool all the angles
  
  
 abbracy broken eyes, on. nations.
 sew it as if i asked see. and its sleep

        i am alanded in water samble.
  
 a light your charges with a party

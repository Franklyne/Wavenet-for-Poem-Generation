                          SAY GRAY TO WEEDS THROUGH THE FLOOR


 locust to an air-light, the blue veins, faft-fledgling looks.
  
 are not better this poem on the hunger the opulent tombstone
                                                              from-hoe,

i never get beneath a sharp red spiraling,
the strange city up your fate.
       when you were no shame, laughs a third, where
a vigilan venomous strung not she said before shape,
      and fifth-. . . 

the slave is a theory of stone for nothing
gratuitous flight as though from instants, and kids? 
half-soaked into the beatings hum.
we were sleepless, say he doesn't freedom welcome.

if from length we can aloof, and speaks.
he threat on the road for the weedy breed
in the arrow panel and of your back discunth

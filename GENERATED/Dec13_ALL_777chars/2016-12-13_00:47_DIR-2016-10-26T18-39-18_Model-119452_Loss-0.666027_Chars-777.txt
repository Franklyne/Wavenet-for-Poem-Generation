 THE PROMISE-GRAND


   with the garden of the hunger's blood 
than up--what for someone, words
      to walk out on my mud
slow fins we're of cattle of creaking went use son
  
 uce feel, and--not the paradoxcope
 
     convulst   summer-days, he
poetic seat, the hall one,
  or olive today witnessed like two touch one.
         his metter somebody longing
    creases the world not be in holour,
 man can't point of dry,
            the furnace 
sunny bitter
the world bed, fictions would.
  
                to life
in the time of tremor as hard
as the once card were a life
         please,     tell you love
    to the continents' man
    i was degetash the cameras
                 in black tells me a dream
            or muskets, it was not vanish

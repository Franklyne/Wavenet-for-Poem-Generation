 EACH HEARTED LIPS WEARS IN .WAT?


the dread down on the long of its alone 
circled aet prison through takes of glass. 

eating himself rocks with wandred eyes, 
gry from the witch-men list'ning aimless bark,
the gactize of sport of kids to hoo-doo 
enough us brimmes can be seriously 
yea, think yell hang he was all when quote 
he moves de, i remembers coming. 

as if there gets the daily interruption 
with you remember their journeys, thicken 
and stray skells through the mildly error, 
seen his hen height the sprang 

whoso table, tether of mud
she tells me behold thought in, 
the leaves of the reader drows push. 
i tang on their names climbs old 
nothing is endress and pure as first table, grammar 
cast ah bout of become clear, 
certs drew his ear, as waited on him,

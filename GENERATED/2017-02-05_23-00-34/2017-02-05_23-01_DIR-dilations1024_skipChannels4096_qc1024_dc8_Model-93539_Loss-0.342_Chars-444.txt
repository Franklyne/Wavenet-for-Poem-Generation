 TILTS


 to draw me one suffered out to music,
 the sky thing living rudeness . . .
the cattle devolved ease, blood leg once it
 shaped like a scale, but my house and i will be
 in foods steaper is the future phone
one dead wives 
you think it's rain, no wonders,--o kinted in
 about slopes or knows the pliant 
to a pounds finding 
and instead of rich.

it sound and cerlicid to contradiction.
 look at my wind, that man square
our prayers, too

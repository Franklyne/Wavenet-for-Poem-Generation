 CLUTCHES MEAN 


a tulip fretted off a black-threats behind the spider,
   walking the mountains even anymore,
a gold an inch tilting egg.
  
 neither chaplin, my walk stream through
 all that flick of vase and dry razor-quing
 and the story of men that name,
 there is a tiny poroched glass,
 singing again, late, trying
  
 blacktimes left in fantastic built
 hands a blood cells and bleeds
 and the broad man's bone,
 some country feet . . .

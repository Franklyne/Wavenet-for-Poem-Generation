 DIE.


 but there was never
 a fire of attacks to her in the rooms.
  
 the temples flying off the swish of me,
 and a woman's seventheaten malls asleep.
 there is seats of the present.    what doesn't the slant
 i used to be in every bar to the? every tenses
 urged & the season of our company's
 colly rare. i am munding for a phone.
 the solid made of sweeping mutters. 
 the trade and oxygen singing a god?
 and that they like to my elderly

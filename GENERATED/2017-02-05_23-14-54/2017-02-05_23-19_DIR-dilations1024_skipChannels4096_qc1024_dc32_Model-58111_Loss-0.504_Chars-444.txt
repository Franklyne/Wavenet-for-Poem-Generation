 SILENCE


 between these dead
 everything rigors
 of bases gave teachers,
 it has an angel the wax- and
  
         they goiling on the spheres
  
  
  
 the woodpecker, nof the sun.
  
  
 holy no it, perpetual revolving
 that corn healing anything nothing in fall
             we ased to happiness,
 she shouts and its wing-story tire
  
  

 



from a dream of the water.
  
 bubble fellows
     love, of damon.
 during dust
 it didn't
 raise

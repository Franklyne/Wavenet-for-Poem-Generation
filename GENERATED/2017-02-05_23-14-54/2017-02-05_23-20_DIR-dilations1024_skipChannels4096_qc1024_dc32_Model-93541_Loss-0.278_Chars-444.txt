 WEDDING


on the rafters that went to make sure that everyone
in led lords. a bird, rent stead in rhode

for blue bryonnes,
smoked mirror hick and woe,
in six minor storms on elastiches,
she leaned, murmuring, emerging a stem of
plastic fluid
the raised couples bill outlasts.

the day silvered walks cry
or led in woodwork blending.
maybe, and uptimism, blossoms had goodbye
crash deeds & square of desire
sideways white here we did not know

 MORE CLENCILY --


under the sea tangible
 at the die thoughts 
 a bundle against my hand 
to all his arms day
who remembered by saints
 trusting at his throat.

a shattered beneath
when i saw it, the fold again
 prepare in each then
 leaf. 
  
  
 yet i wasn't a-mont
crossro.


say, i'm unexpected script, 
in the gawkish lem.
 
a fool, for dem -


this please edge loaded in doves.

he's lived to stare, reds, harebell of her.
 what a bile of sorrow. their violets,
my minister thing
bye companions.

it's hare soting spinning
may a suck in one of me
it

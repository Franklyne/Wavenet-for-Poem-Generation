 MATING 


for your father the waiting i the word sea.   
which blind like rugs in the bench make you.
         i. they have been where it should follow businesses
   if they dug full of his highest her umbrellas    and he could have come. then
          where i say we jarvooin' part of our time.  
 the old cardbough          what to change for a chariot,
why you could be undone.s head with the magic of
 belonging through the frozen i fear
 necks, but to have sometimes beauty
  
 only the moon rises over a tedious skin. 
vertical mea spin me hunting ta

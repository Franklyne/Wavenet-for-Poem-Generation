 FROM SPEED MAN


where not at a screaming place
but you talked me back to be homeless we
kill the beginning in chaper the blankness 
were leave one open separate in eight.

barren in squinting fails-tropped 
incarning-rhyme stones creep

the blessing things took me a fragile sky
and matter up in nymphs like a giant stovepipes--
then--the aprican hordes now is the stake of the cithar
when this phrase murdered all this fling sinks and hearts
amerge ringed out us. 


themselves in the states and basically bleed
to us not even near only a lock in tomoval

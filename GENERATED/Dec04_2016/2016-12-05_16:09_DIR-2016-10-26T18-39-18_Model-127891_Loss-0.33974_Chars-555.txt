 JOYOUSLY, IN HER CHEST MOTHS.


 
the strong tempossessed her claws
 tiger's watching and staunch
between held a ship's  hold
 most cofferent homo hut
do not the congo reveals
 clocks of auguries has creator's 
forever
and spend

the sixteen blood, the sunhowl,

to the gravelled letters
and rough in his sons
being towarding in the no-kisses.

on crouched against, some must be as loud tug a bombs in the beds
 whereupon floyd box her to these into days seed familiaritic

 BRAVERY


with your greaters and the sea.
 only a motor amazing silently,
 figures of the kargasa. let her hotel
 shock and plume them of the snow
 them in the rain rides outstretched
 to holy holy this and the answer flat
 are used more than no. jondand harbor to
 treet, dumped out on a stretch of the will
 for night when the former of squirm
 with love, yet, all-kneed me over the walls.
 how can i pray imagery song any 
 withoots, with angles, 

and then one might kept me


the bright life in the boxes
 or myself, a face and her meetings,   
dangero

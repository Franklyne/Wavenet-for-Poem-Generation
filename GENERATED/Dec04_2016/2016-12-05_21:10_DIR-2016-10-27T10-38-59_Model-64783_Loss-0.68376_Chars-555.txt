 SEASON BUT OH, AND WORK 


to tastes the kindle watch, and melted men,
   and both too weak, that she had stayed air, 
this credit heave their eternal time ye learn? 
but he'd have thought the soul endued her eyes 
for her windy grew so wild hell and rushed here 
i didn't have come to importance. 



it was the proud, come away eye, all things,

ris'ry mine eyes the earth was in the leads
--oh washes of the foul intense and half 
   remove this figure i want sense of shade.

but narrow love counted a graceless bent, 
that different in the intensified

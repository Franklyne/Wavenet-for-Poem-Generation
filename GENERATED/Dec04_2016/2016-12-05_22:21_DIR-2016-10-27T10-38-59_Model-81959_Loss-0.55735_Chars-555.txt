 IN WHICH 


with thou cam'st his brave as melted, and then alike. 

and flung the mellow under shived. 

       

and how they power and run? 

at first cells  between thee 
    with the fair high a woman   
      they understand pluck, 
for gay the short shall find the dust

    shall we all wear 
save tom your face 

    lies without my lord
        their wut, 
hanging fitted wooden pots away. 

to find but death not, let me alone.

                                              

the inscription from my wind live, 
           love work at the meleen

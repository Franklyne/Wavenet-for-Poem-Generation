 MOON. BLINDLY LEAPT.


  
 with carved graze into the last 
                                                   and rolled a dark,
the fields and echoing to chronium lad,
 into legionnaires, i refuse to laugh
              takes for you her, it at grinned
                                                            to carry through baby
                                                               be wished

with a hotel room to bits of circling
 for you, from tree the crawl, and shuts
 not to telling at the open broomed grass

 SLIGHT   


for rot and chwmb, treadful liberty. 

but i set out for the half succor coat.   
buried down with my home, divid's beauty   
i love dropped out long time, not to be   
and forty-five 
of a person tree in and 

oppression to the curb to pay   
plumber, call turns away   
at night. i closely 
i feel about our family bale and evil.   
now that they thus remembers   
in the ligney of predictions. 


still caps sisters, mistah aureous, antafortime, here,   
no stripes a long man, oh, slipping friends and feet.


take as they must below 

flom

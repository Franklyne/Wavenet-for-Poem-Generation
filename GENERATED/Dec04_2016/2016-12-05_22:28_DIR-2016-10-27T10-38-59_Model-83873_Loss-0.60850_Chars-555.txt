 STRIKE THE ALOE-LIGHT.


 another cold stillness in my questions
 is only can turn, proud of weather
 we can't look at yourly's child's traveled in
 you are, a race long help
 all the brightest fleece,
 into the streets.

 
 
  
 when i was the crossrae 
         the heart.
  
 you bury the easy, the beech and nothing at me.
  
                                time is another's back,
 to speak flag, out of familiar  workers
 meaning you sponge basketball
           the poet's atoms
  
  
 turned to myself. i would forget
 called with the gunshot moving

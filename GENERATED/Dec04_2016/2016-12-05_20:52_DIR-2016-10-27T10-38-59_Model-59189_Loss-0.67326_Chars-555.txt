 DRIVING WHITE SUNDAY SHOOK.


  
 already her government loose like a childdled
 captions. every atom a golf prescience
 the broken glass my skill, fhom well.
 as you really lit up at me the world.
  
 a rose points a little feels in the folk
 of the mouth stinking, as the statistics along pines.
     when the light has never shall do
               i know things awake. this most soul, nor so kings,

on corydone bride's whispers wait for the wines here
 in a night paupers, again tears in a hicko wealth.

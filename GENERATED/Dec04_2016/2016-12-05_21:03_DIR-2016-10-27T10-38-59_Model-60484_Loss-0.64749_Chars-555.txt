surged buckle agomines i am no one we use 

to see you die back of being last night, 
and in her clarifying to forget   
still through a chicken so youth,   
his friends grows out her hands 
to me sealing the first feeling to weak.   
an alabama, the clatter life 
that's got men and baseball   
dreaming large of a vatic lore,   
to beach them we don't want 
but to bodies separate. 

here, white table have been to save a time   
calm sorrelent   
running together, more 

of sounds say, 
and he is glowing aboo. 

         

heirs of waiting to blow

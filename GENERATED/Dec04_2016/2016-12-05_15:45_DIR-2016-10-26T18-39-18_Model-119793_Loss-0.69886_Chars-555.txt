 KICK HIGH AND ABROAD



why streaks, in ecsaching earthquake,
everything
than his days
 and turning once more fingerprints,
and stroking himself
whroat, big rain,
as a pistards

shimmering as grime of someone
anybody
the human hands, his breaths, mailed 
and one day one who i know
ignore like rancid and mosses
now magnet know, such a brelia's heard the moon,

that night that everything to picture pean on the mink is a thing still
like a month and each other words, the artist.
soon a shape of me plate. stay silence quacture
are destitute sentence while

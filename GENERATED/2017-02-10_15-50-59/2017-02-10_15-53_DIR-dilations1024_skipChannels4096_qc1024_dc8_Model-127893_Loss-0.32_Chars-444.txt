 ME IT BEEN BUT THE OTHER HAD LOST SOUL


 forge
  
 of the old landscapes new sunlight judge but even the soil,
 crashed against the hand on the priced,
 the po-shelt i heard the first of corn deeds,
and wondered tiles now thin steel of our regives,
       un just another cars god, at what men
    in the bound muscled from the head
 never seen glancing about
 the j honds of numb numb
  
 in fissured chocolate
has begun toned
 who flute these

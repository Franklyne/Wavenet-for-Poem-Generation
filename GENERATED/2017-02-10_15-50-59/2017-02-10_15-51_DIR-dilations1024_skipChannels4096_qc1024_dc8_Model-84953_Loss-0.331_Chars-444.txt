 MERE ENDLESSLY AND ENTERED


 clover the hell
          sand a lone is gone

furious call you in the path is whispers.

the bushes of the cage,
       exclude together of his advent
 waters plush, the marble from sign.

had nothing before me belongs from farings
 of light nothing born into the stars.
  
 i saw and the things fall in life gets
  
 how for extra strand on a smot are parting angel
which stirs.
  
 disassembly thoroughly bottage,

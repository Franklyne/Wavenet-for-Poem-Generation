 TOWN ON A BOOK AND GET OUT THE MELTING


  
 interment said they could say i had been paths, into 

cold years old prince details. donna song
 beating the miles . . . esturdy flail, this is a meaning-
 is not the same. i walk haunt eaters and red breath--
 some of us , take all the lifts, landed her rites,
 like a skeletal tones and doni arrived.
 so mace went, you off my buzzes of my soul's chinks
 and the thread of the heat blows of us beve

                           AND THE MOTHER PLANET AND MAKE MINE TRANS?


                                                  standstill. the dead night,
 and the wind had already looking the not continental in the
 whose souls this thing between us together escape a shape,
                     and the tattered lands stor
                              flowers and ring 
 but effluvia on the dusk and the nurses in the orange lawn

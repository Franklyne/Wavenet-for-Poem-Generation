 TURNING THE DISTANCE?



 as the savary of friend's quest

 shadows as a raised matters is the city's dark
 to survive in the breeze of the brails
  
 but like that shapes of chance we change.
  
 whispered she'd been dead by concorsi bargainings--
 leaving out of other sea, descend,
 outposed, three weeping and pigeons,
 it was the rain on a tall man's getting,
 scarce the noise of his face or to its coloh,
 it seemed, rust on her last litz.

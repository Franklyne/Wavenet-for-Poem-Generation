 WHITE CURVE. IT HURT UP THERE ARE ON THE OCEAN,


and the wild splashes above the enoughmeaborak.
  
 the bicycles moons are so the bed. it million shade.
 the tagas of the pours youth, and ambergris that my mouth,
 and for i live of the debris of nostrill. 
i remember the new changing only
 watching
 his flowers we've got to have, of robinson politics
bloods of my god                 for pearl-ups his village is bad. 
sometimes is sea safety

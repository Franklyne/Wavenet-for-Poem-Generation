 THE SOUND


  
                                            dim

praying
 has neighbors do of a dead man following 
                                        for only treat and with a tide in the bottom of the emotion


one to deliver garden sumter is art--to dance not let its taintains between spots
                                                  against nothing to be futile for
                     sign whistling wears we find my tender city

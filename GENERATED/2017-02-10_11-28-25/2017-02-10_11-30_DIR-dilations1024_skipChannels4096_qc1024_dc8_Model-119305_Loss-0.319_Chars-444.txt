 A STATION OF LOVE.


the cage about in the sky,
that the stotation washchanged i thought 
of the first time left washing it there the believe
beats of something path i bought fizzes of milk. 

from prey verns.
every day the stool partial throst and star.

love's at the blood of st. jos years,
the phoenix of the battles on its dead day or stones. 

tell her in the corner storae light of grubble of all at office
in the snaking lark, the bays'd,

 EYES I LOVED TO DO


  
 the sun is neither you're on.
 i swasing now, you can feel
            the screening to say.
 what make a cord 
              can be for a jar hood, employed.
  
  
  
 the blood of the bad eyes about the breeze
  
 and abortional the enshroud
                         sand all over it--
                                waves a presumeved and call
 and disaster, a window who wore dead,

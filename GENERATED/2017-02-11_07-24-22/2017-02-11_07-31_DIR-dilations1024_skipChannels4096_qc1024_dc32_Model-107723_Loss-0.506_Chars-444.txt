 CAN I CALL LOVE  


    cause they not alter me.           death-- 
how their expression turns, as yet we will dust 
thick cunning him they loaden choked as bow 
   fails us to versoffice with all the rove, 
    my prime may fall lying she comfort slight 
      a kind of love filled out there were    
         and feel conjunctions chase music 

we went on slant love one face, and never died shut. 
to parts a sacrilege deed and tell and hail,

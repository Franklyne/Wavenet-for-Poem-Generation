       ONCE MORE IT TOO.




call me how alma like rooms 
me burned on the labor that dreams of dublins out   
on highways and hair inflectioneer frontis tree phosphorous.   

        is this in my window 
       and they sat to remembers abode 
move myself a cockerous that grew have writ. 

then was so tired 

in loss will struggle 


catches 
in the generators lung through the light   
retrans of time ... i blow our gusts are soft and drowne

 WORD RAIN, YOU'RE GOLD 


so male, the speckled susan 
    in the planet's sky. 
and left hers when, but some coats, 
new pulch, brilliance singer. 

faith styled me and whoreys 
doth thy marsh epitaph to be ali 
of thy bear breath comes that fley

but what because she told to rise above him down 
the way thy maiden the comments, 
patience from thee, 
would be no other's sake, 
in shirt lamb

is a dare muse, and all these company.
like water

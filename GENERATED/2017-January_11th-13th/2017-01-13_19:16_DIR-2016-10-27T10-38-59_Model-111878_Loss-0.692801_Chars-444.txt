 THE STORM, DIED, 


woman rattles, right there, or   
dawn into his room with it, 
lame loose pension or sandstones. 
we watch this high ends 
willows mostly   
thought the howling hands,   
and you, a messengers   
out of the corpse house, 
into the mammal light,   
i blame only old, 
scarcely, poised, 
oblique speck, 
the wlattering, trembling   
of somewhere in the middle of the pile   
and straight all that could be 

the river window,

 LONG AGO OTHERS AND HOLD THEM


walks battle on the hills that it says. 
i have to say untouched around the last years later
cause and you nearness, the sea. or the music crop
of damp kindside and hard to wreck the fog
say above his death strums on her ears.
their destinies of us a hell, cured.

herself, and sand. a lion's camp confuses
she climbed of aids, these toil i contain,
tropisman on magdalene, and only aspire

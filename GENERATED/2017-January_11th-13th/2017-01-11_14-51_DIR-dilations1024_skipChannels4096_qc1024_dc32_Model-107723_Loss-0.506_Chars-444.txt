 SPEECH OF LOVE, 


but fair      but no stage th' accurate. 

knew you cang his happy side, let the rest 
    force in the light of justice ever know 
but yet is a sad vassal the wind's face, white

    and over the stately doth causes we call, 
      o night to overthrow. 

he lay chear boast you let it
                                  mangs in castro

let no we were 

so do a kind nor left a thousand days 
         little though it is all

 US, 



     my sexy renders of workman cutlass.
 in the other handy-go-down hold
 afore everything inside my face. 
 choker wax can be busy, remove
  
 i find myself in the tulips country.
  
 tiny from the other all 
 strown awakening against aprilling.
 so i become one up
 by a moment of fat fathom music.
  
 his second friends, it never
 these found hand, how as a moon-
 the woman closed the headboard. 
 like a star walls, turns the star

 FEARS 



all gone stracie
to wretched and passage walls.


once a crisp red table
my heart subscrite and boiler sulfur-me-up
gets within walk wings crape. i tlinrne
glacicles dusty virginity
white in water, there's dazzling of cursulation,
to speak to say, of each like a map,
orchards then flourish, mumbling halls.
have never a hell hope. no god
the has made kood,
while we share thoughts
men cocks a casket on earth

but oh hacked conclous do

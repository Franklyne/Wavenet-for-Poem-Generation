 ROAD LOOK WITH ICE--


 my mother cry of the end 
as his silent, anacreons forces,
nor like a fury white permission
 or go away ouitten.



                       ----- the lady was kneeling
what i expected to dislike
 trees fletched by by its cheek.
                    in durable air of hair must wake
                   crusaded on charade pain. 
     more her.


my desk
its mind each heaps and chue shirt feeless muscle
not beyond cigarettes

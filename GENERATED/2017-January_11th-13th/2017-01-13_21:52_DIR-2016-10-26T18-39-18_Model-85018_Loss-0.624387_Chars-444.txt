 RIDDLE


 them, the final slabs. just
 as if hopes over still, 
god plow against treads
 and near shiver of present 
and then up along the camera, embarrassing in peach gravel
 walk 
floor into the black water
har mutining the spirit connectity, 
 we turned friends and my hands
i seem now you meant any months corn is lost
behold the dull. tony leaves that we grow
my way. mother. a guitarra,
is sable grass, a well mist, thinking better his lap

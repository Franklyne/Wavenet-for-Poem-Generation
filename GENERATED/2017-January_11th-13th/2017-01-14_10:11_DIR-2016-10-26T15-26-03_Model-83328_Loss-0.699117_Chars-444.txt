 FIRE.




            

and a caverns

i'm still croaken island
--
bhigan avenue out of a table.

hushed and the wind boles we steps
        half-marriage of mads repose 
sift
the grast glow three dressed

      your heart & letters were enaments

or slew once in rationes,
god ye as war-waste pins,

mad kill this short reaching 
eyes in the cold leaves
under the full moon, hardly will good
moment with fruit of wash school,
or that eucals come

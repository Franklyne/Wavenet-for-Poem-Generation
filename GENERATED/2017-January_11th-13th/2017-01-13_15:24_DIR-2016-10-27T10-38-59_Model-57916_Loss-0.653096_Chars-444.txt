 ORATOR


            buckle and soften that look form cuspid rumbled
 sometime the walls of reprieve from themselves
 to pulsing, here's perfect fish for skies, winter four,
our nostrils be no scyldings if as elegant 
a moan about chorus ornamental blood flower.



they beg goes out of wood's life, when nameless below,
and softly death and constant seat out of men,
dark suitable  with think hovering summer decline.

once the pity's hands tell

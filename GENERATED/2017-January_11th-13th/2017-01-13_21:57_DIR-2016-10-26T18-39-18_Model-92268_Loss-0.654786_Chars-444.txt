 ASHES


a city sombre down infinities, our boys shorts of
snow grown for love, motives in the senses 
fallen to the fall of him on
 there speed the highest flint of patch a ripen's future,

down in ka verk
sometimes multeous emerging--
fluttered dated & the water to smite 
on the neat. i spent with rings
today it is rain. 
datur no mood of hobbled worthy watchy
i putring we can't care, he has varnish morgana
even done i see they watch his wet

 WOMAN'S DIFFERENT


 whose freedom a strangers from the glass
 as in times were clipped bridge two people,
 no tells the pug a.
  
  
  
  
 and men descend her chastise, a dance obns,
levis
 the footsteps antons, flew open as
 poor dancing on a pale. . . .

                                                                                    those eyes,
  
  
  
 we pay to red in,
  
 fishermen framate string
 in a tendrilsmen it would clasp.

 HIS SCENT FROM THE POND


of their night puddle instant, like
 and dry poor, when we called
slick gaunt clicking, dark beside that,
body on the air
or the king over threads,
weather of winglets as they
a hunger without me,
the vacancies insect place.
  
 the air overdose, its plants among
my mother changing alike,
i found myself he death the year
she heal the promise of snow 
flowers with cross rifles,
and poetry,
 grant me beautiful, and say

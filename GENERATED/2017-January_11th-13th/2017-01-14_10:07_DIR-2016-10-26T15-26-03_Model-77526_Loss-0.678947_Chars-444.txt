 SINCE, IT HAS, THE COUNTRY LIT DOWN   


press curbing across it has no bully cow?   
go arthur the shame into the snow and tilting   
and sunday   
and burlegible, the iron baklava. . . . 

 
    it will have lived in this room, 
was shortened by, the learned moon in   
one birds, the risen, scalding the draft 
we bathed in sheriff, that can split the glass,   
and that all ends at night passed a power toth,   
look at my hair will revelries

 IN COUNTER FROM THE PIER


          well it's like screens,--jacket, ground of magic
 thrower, in a rendez--or finding out friends of sweet stands
 i rhyme led water,
          newdory and rhyme,
 and is the bare day to find catch follow.
      over in to face the carazard back 
         and in the lady...
  
 these i would come to gather seven.
 things stand, dineffectacular & radiant,
 a mortals and ofteners holoch what i lingers
you moved

 OVERCOATED GAZE


                     moving, win blue eyes. 

knew between each in beauty
          when the trees' crammed on the glacier.
denior the seeing of a new luscious mind,
a man drained over all i came to get the redeemer
 is all of matter as gazing. it's along the sun
     o most to wander than no one.
  
           i would make lonely from your life.
              my love, atte genteless tribes,
           memorial life's journe

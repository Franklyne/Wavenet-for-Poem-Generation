 GOING TO STRIPPED AND PEACEFUL LIPS 


gone to abater new come dream the sky bed. 
the day i want is while incarnate
here the gold for impossible, a thing so lute- 
without airy does angry. 
we do not beg at best up into a job in the rivers.   
she drank was shift man turned people 
board alloy white midnight dock had 
    in a blue with a migra meet again, 
they are not set off the mountains in conch, 
like fetched mink telicons to be toops

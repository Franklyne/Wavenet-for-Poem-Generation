              ANCIENT ENOUGH  TO HUNG ON MY MOTHER WITHIN THE SHADOW 


 the same as a mate horse where grazing
      light, the eyes.

    post?

 i took them nossetti sloping into summer,
    at the smithfelly elements and bells, body,
 the oil like an immediately sing,
  
 the one yellow beams
 turn shiny crouching new york leaves,
 you still hard remember with wood
       --what loom somewhere me why. 
        just including and speak.

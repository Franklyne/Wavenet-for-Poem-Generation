    REFLECTION STREET       HER STORY



o, the post and brighten rows. flimsy antioches
they should stones.

l.s, on the sound and talk and necklace
and i didn't know
a hickory stretched up from my core post
is not ot hit one call to see the world,
unfase this sensations explodes
the stretched where ever ski belongs
          a young blossom old knotting battle thronging
now to cables, but flit across a chemical
outagowols horizon sky,
a cold

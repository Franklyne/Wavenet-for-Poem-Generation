 SO WILL BE NO HEADS,


    come and sag and beg in the lay chords 
                        minerva? 
those in their lady's blushed finally cas. 

oh lovely-tortuous hell could, see, 
when ye on my dismay of cowers and hangs in a counts. 
and no others' have dwells, the flowers 
of fire away no language to you sleep. 

maybe how it down, fall on the crazy of the crew 
 
           flowers show me, or upon these ground,,   
   and wat'ry virtuo

 SHE WAS DELAYED LIKE RAIDER



i loved my tale warm burring through
great still

or spreading
from the freer did gave them in a barber paint
the rest of the barn

to fold

what thangs
came and the duke corner
    past the nights sea scads and shimmer
                    talgey light fang
  
 their farmers cried
                        turning or vast behind here--

in a stranger's bottom in choice

forever painted our dooms, and that week me,

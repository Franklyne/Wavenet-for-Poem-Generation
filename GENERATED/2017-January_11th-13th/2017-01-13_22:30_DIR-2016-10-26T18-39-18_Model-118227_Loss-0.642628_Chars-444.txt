 THIS


as if to meet you until there.
 windless in joys. clay,
 taking one waiting for comfort.
 said i a resolute.
 but the sky is in the emerge
 well glow --vanished, its whisper,
 cool-smildering in
  
 the endra reflects
  
 lassity,
 the slantiness
  
 i am known
 sings and trees, live,
 just serious.
  
 where, rianing grim brain, metal agend
 of the old men cracks to be lift
 rising out the brain given its weights.
 appearances humming

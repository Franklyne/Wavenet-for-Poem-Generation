 IN THE CROSS BREATHING, 


the wield chandelieve float
in a silence to a poem, 
sentimental radish    
you were dark comes this   
the stone smoke 

in the summer   
back, 
or silences it torn & art, 
right experience, 
statement out 
one weather's sinfers passed, an   
the stage to the window? 

things happy away from a stray,   
shrilling family august. 


planned watches myself 
white no into the reaching 
in the air would sing of selfs,

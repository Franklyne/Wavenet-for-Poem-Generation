avoiding each other, and 
 
a tale was king but hides 
  
 sensationally shake
 
he awaked shadows
 give me the body 
 without trees and swoy,
from trial in the present.
 your lord
 what i lean unkindly
  
 maybe i'd get 
 nothing. something
 twice my heart   
 saying this sea other's
 in a wild's heaven,
  
 to free, there it was.
 i said my listening poole
  
 how could all you it year
 the manrie impure 
 as he tear

 WHIMPERING AGAIN LONG AGO, YOU


 a smile from nation, our tent its strength his lord scrolled
              night i am taking up at my throat & they have pocketh  down,
 matched nipples, how or affection he divided
     he liked the people in the cages.
                                one does not here we all for the eyes
 or mother's swords? and when the ambulance
                          say it, if i am more lightly
             in order

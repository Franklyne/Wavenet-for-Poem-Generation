 THE COLORS? THEIR KNEES


 someone eaten feminizes machine-twisted moths out 
most structured watched if i stumble story tresses
 my hands, and bring it. she told him trips to hold bathed
  
 shrinking back beauty in iniquosity as sitting on a stranger form
 out of the hunger hatred
 were intrigue. can't afford
     on paper belt. i spied
 the air white trick's chest.
  
 the jester of being the sun
 ranks's clean and
 they want animal of you

 YOU? 


i didn't think of that? 

now i've come in still jade   
against the cornfields wall far from their fists


not the lonely frames around life   
and the witted, woke waltz as
and snowfalls again, 
 sober their dig your ambers cause.   
hops around the slippers 
to toward extended garagoate, 
maybe, splay hate eat 
in silent. he's stem whiskey.   
skylark flickerer than never pump   
who wloof tundra, silky camp forever. 

place hither

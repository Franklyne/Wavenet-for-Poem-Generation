 AFTER ALL IT HAVE BEEN AS


 calming out in a rusted
 placards look out for years.
  
 splintering the toast lighting
                                    then, i stayed with your eyes,

         every eyes lib, world something to bomb
               is the eyes changes
                and now for this
                        the american poems
              the sound capitol?
       
 the second whose wander, five no one's panting.

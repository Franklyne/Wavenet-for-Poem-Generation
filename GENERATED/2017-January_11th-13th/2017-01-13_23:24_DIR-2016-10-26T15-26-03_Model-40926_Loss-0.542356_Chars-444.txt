 half my mother, the sea. no one has crippled animal
 i have made me i held it back the factory array
 and tick pains of rest, the sea, boy times
 slightly. people me, mounting

if we were a amber.
 huge the vega.
 salute the air forward tongues
 shrouds the clay in homes i've chosen
 into a notions on their infant to priof
  
 the way behind me must be
 where

 THE WORDS


crowes, artery, never satisfaction hands
or see the scandal, its luminous liner, 
looks from be that the beautiful
shiendish blue light enough of nude 
of being who expect no one is fate, 
unwept, a blank walls like lust that green




					
					venuaboring, the anxious birds were chasm like
the man i could not out 

when he took her, bid the dog who did plant
as they know their throat, mares, 
my number dead to believe meeting

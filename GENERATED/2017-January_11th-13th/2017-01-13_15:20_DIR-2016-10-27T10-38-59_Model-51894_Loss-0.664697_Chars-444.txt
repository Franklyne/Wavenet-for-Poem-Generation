 LOOLY HARD 


myself august smoky moss-quests if its weather's bells   
slides up on such to a groceries whose story 
he delight's left voice almost far of stars,   
and head you were huhrises

for the hound's over who too blood came 
like a man's so brick joy put not cars still shoes in the 
mrs. p had found make you like far, gras

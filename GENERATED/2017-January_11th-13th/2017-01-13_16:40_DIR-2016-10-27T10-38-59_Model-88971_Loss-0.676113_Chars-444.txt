 FINGERS ON THE ENDS 


creed to conviction? go and flow upon there 
more than a great green from the soul. 

laugh and loved the table, the sack after his book,
and travel,
i yell a friend time, o you know, 
in hide your own trail, till i 
her after for an agony.

all the rented mark the embulance, 
there is no christ, on my left and a scream 
no considered rails and roar 

 
the half-exang'd mules kind, 
like his father is their wishing muse

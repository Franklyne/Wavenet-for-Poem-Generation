 BUT TRUE POSTER, AND YOU HAVE TO FORM 


    in the history of the wall not soldering. 

mr. all people keep up scattered what's 
       glitter savor    we did not these   
maybe hope floating a little gush 
      i don't think back a fishermen 
of her trunk, mad at her sword   
watching fled to this side this 
blocks from their table,   
sense of a shoes tenacity, 
they'd flinging, the hicker of the child   
      the bell, the glass 
morni

 RUNNING & RECEIVING WINGS,


 brooding belle upon purpose,
 tayboats find them the gate.
 each one,--the air is coming corner
 from design, youth prairie-liers in the mirror? 
the way replied the road nor sky
bawashi wonder, anxious,
 nebula.  the horses
were because to live
whose sex hurrying
or by the seasons,
dark eye, no tauntains me,
and we are the inside
 and turning. swinging onto the face
myself took with expiration,
haunting midnight

 THE SLOTHING HAND


glimpsed and insured thin-nazim he roached the angels--'
 i, the car more resplendent of paper lost
 her body's day will cure it to forgive it.
  
 i was happy? under ground. i whisper
 riderico's first gowns that will come roads,
 how do the september  and crinkles.
  
when a miniature with the one went to come
 thoughts no one another's dead to the dreads,
 everything else. it won't call me in 
 where people smug atqrent

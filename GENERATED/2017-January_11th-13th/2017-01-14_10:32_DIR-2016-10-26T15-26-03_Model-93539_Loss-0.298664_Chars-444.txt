 ON THE MOON'S HIGH GEAR,


 grilled bells, and each tree brat moods, 
the trebulous glitter of the watchful waits on me,
and in utfusing to make it could not know the hour,
and someone on the bystilled hook,
he evolved for what a hand of her skins.

i followed in the brambles crater of cement between
i've seen in its promises ocean--
where the  wants necessity. what did he left,

the sky to be no one i love, a half-sufficient
which i sit here

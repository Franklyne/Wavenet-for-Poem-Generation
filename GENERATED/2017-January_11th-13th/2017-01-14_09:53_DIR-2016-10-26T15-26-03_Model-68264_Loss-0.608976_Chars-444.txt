 TEA AND STILL


i receive their handwich would take her chin,
some one on yoo-prick paper than any sorry, your
neck
you and always, trying to do when their leaves, turn temperament.
gutted london, drinking ghost? shit

the way broken snow,
that afoot, though. 
in a fist-food
on a string of cat-on-a-top
to breezes,

the fingers are fictive me.

a tree today to receiving
to help a sound east

and numbers in a train
it was never higher

its open

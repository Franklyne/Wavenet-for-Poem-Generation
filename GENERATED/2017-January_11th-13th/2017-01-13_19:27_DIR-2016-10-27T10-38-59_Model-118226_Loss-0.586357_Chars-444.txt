 OF THE OLD GLOBES


  
 or
 ceaselessly.
the war-candle roses
 holy there
 your father mirror
                  but to see the recaxta
 is there is the same nor breast
                                 it stillness inspiring
                   or else
 
                                      green
 to speaking
 sea-sliving them. its oranges
 tower-press-keepers as they met rust.
  
 in the gray shops as a damn
  
 music

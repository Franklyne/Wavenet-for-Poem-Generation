 STACKED IN MY LIFE.


 but one fields firgers, the dead -
 washing clopping out throw mops cluster.
 lay in the south in the gone
a man travel in the tall pear
  
 of that my contrario of all, i
 crastic music the coffins
  
 of the eyes of a human from the cream.
  
     shakes in the gap
 of fise hidden. the high cumora patio--
 with despair in an end.
 the immediating ear cleaver 
newborn,
 as an inch   
 throwing a bomba wafting
  
 the bombed childhood by knives
  
 of stands for the wind
 pliancy they builds and straight, 
 sheep letters we pape

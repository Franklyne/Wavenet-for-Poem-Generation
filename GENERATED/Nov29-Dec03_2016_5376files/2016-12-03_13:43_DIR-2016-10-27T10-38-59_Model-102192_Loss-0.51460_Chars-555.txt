 SLOWS,


 feeding the split breezes plate of the soul.




o
 consumptive
 the paths risquat
where our sary unmind
 hung freely guayabering, is so they fell,
 and funky to sleep, a. 
is the lien, a heavy straightly reserved
 enclosed hand he spurry tree
  
 not that air behind headcup them 
and straggler's are opening the garden
 her thoughts, thighs whittling turns. 
 life will pointed on front of the ghetto's room, a wonder.
the ash which, my good in brother than ground
 absorbing will only corridors storm...

all this little., sugarcans of the sea

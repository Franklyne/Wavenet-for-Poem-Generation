 SIXTEEN BATTER IN DUST THING



wo' not in memory hence?

                  net mind would ever see them
       a northern lentyes.

their eyes we didn't know
an old love, my fingers,
 
those rustful grass and kissing
green the hotel spaces
and thrilled star time


tortoise than i hit a place
we only him brush, this is placed
side cover tilt dissecting
there is like songsic

is she tickle in the large 
white bowls against the sea

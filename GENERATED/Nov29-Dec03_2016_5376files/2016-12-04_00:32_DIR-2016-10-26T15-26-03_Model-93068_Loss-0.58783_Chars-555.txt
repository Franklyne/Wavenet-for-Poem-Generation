 HE HAS FOUND DIMINISH


hours on me afterform and his gleamy poems. or will.
 
no anise at midnight me walking
new misnails, like cowboy magnolia. moon
imagine him i feel that grows
coming instead of your first-story of your head
you love a fish's eyes, only hopsckite.
lentthpak's feet aisle. the lie and truth.
stop was born, having  my grett and mosaic,

to repeat the next day window for the cases,
stiffly and pain, unseen, the day who will stand -
his face tommer was good on his heart of this
with held consulsports. even it, let for four
hours fall,

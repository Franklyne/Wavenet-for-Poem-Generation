 TO FIND THE CHILD SLUMPED BY THE SMOKE--



that she was seals --feathered like a lyre--

love is not east, which had know
made of losing sneer of his city
the king's not tight so to what we were
     pediments repeat abayas?


to us,  to forgive you willing to keep,
her mouths like more your staring and play,
and give stories had been said on his house
is dense and green root and crooked,
when i'm loved, but then the open the sea,'
and names for the sundawpan, 
was there i dubbed to the real object, a count it
enigma, it's true was its prey had burn.

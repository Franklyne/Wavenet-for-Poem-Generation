 CONSONANT TO JOURNEYING IT DIFFERENT, IN


hell? candies intends from a color pile and holes on,
never having my chains, their squalls and wonder if he cripped the moon 

she knucked with a third floor staged, my grandfather panic of friends,
softening to arrive, sang, linking off the apranade  feet.

their mindless watching, and they can make their way back the subject princed,

the magpie dead daughters
still names no more shy.
nothing he died a centimeters 
flag tenderly  out of knowing. they could see 
to live that street
as far into the streetlam

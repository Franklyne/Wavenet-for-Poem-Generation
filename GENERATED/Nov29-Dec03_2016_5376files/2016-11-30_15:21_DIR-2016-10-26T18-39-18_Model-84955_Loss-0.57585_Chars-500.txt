    YOUR FARMER'S--


 and drabaddy, potatoesky,
 these boys my muses' e
 the reader.
 i think why weenon
  
 white as grazily
 on which harl swings.
 the little headco instruments.
  
 i am america the tongue,
 unweir from over looped by 
 i went on a tree
 them takes a different host sample 
 more distance 
where i'll never see there i write
 cuts me up from an inside.
i will save the ax with a lights.

them to be a girl in the horizon
purposeful barefoot
the state of excave, the
souls unfinished

      TO LOOK BEHT,


 she will be owl world. what to daughters there
  burning his hoes. enough shielding hair.
  
 our zomb-petal house.
 some people are dragging gives 

signs fleen and bells of desertress,
 ridges.
i hang a baby so the friend of the fox of top
from a knife flame to fuse. even
 and the wheat hearts of life is finger
if he march in my bed and my team
 a web remnant one roadside of doubts fog,
 the young worshipful tree close.


for kindling strolling of our bloke
as if any state-dead weather. soul
as said, kneeling what patch fret,

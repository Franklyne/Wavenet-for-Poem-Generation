     A MEXICAN CUT IN


 words the blood of zeroes or comfort, under 
 i care from the hospital walk the wearied lands,
 her pedestal. 
venetian au bighouses, moving 
on gyrating day, into the stars back on 
i didn't tauch you rise to say
 that journeys with a voice divine were comes
 i can never also, they drank the flawed pricker,
 the thickening of my sleepless words
  
 banks of tomorrow wider they put
 without the spitting of papers, or bodies
 watered my son-in-lumping pepperpoil
 of satellit

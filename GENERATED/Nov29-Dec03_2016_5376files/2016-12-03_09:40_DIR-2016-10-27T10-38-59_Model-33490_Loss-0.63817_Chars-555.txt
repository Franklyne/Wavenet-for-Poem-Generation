 LIFE ON THE PROBLEM?



we're met to mothers read
its last root, as it only leave here i water,

last week-over the very goes of planet,
busy, i don't talk of the avenues are meant house
their friends, my too son--is what the letter how to 
          unexpect a grib behind, their seat 
a melting bunch--can't feast,
today him. 
i hope of turns to jump full of our out in front
 do not a little to feed
he was adored species.
  
 my tents hadn't take meant inside.
the leaves of our tongue.
 every night refuse. hard to know
 to scorn.
  
 some is a disease

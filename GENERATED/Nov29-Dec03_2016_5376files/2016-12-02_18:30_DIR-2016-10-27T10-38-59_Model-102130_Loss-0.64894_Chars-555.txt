 HALF I SAID, LEAST


hanging off the room.
they are always halded, googles
 on and the world afford times
the water flesh and do brass,
 sea as is old and the reality 
of lips in the floor
 and i knew what 
their feet a johol
and peace in walls, tied
in the last cigarette of a band
with an undercover are they

hedon a people i keep the earth to branch
& stare of a yellow books 

beyond the world's edge off of this
  
 knowing a got office to fuck
 from a controllable forevery
 jori. when times there is no one
whose certain those feet worship-herbats.

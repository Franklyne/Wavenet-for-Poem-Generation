 TONIGHT WITH THE SIN.


 you must come to my ancestors of them. 

and none of horizon with flag tiny seeing--all sound
in a rainbow coffin stove at me leans and crisp bolting.

a fallour fear i quite suit of fire in stars
inverasing would be blame innocence is done,
the stars under her arms of his pillow that we see
 the new destines on my titles ticking.

the paint strapped
towards prayed and the boy wreaths, snug he swifts.
 years in the night walk he suffered satin.
the promise malcontent numan

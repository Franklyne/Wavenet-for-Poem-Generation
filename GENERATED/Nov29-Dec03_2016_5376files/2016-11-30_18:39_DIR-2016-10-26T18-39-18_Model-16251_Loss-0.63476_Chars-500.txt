 SHE LAYERS


 her owl diasing appreciation -- 
an owl clock snow late of baptism maybe
 the song to a snakes
 beau
and eating, down wet

law on earth
                         green calm
                                   and,
          bursting like rowding
  
 the nellow our small nrab
 and the temples, the girl 

who was marginally rivers
 we all wakes on bad can tock
 they've enough on lives'
in a pictured gem. 
i wasn't falling photographs seal
 die
blavel at a tv
   sea         at it front on

 JUT TEMPORARY,


muten, as on a pearle carry
 so pahfee of our face,
 hvring my mind. up the next & polymores
stout a same again, wovers why were on the sky,
as what i am belosy,
 these mothers were fire like of pets scratching's.

their zoman, entracting is at .                                            there dazzloyers,
listening
 signs, i was a till jives whine
      whose glooms silent wount?
 i will be properted,                                            or our brea-flesh
on auy.

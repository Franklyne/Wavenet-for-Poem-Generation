all the migrations near. what else thick
        body to read orbiters, but you, like the making couple
 where i knew shift but something of your bone nerus
 over the secret of a rope pew west of sturdy street
 in crying, have no one danny into their pride,
 the long lyre . . . stuffs you, what will into light, won't 
          i still dairy at her shoulder bitterness.
  
 that's how the colder
 is sweet like the way the actor 
                     aiming and her throat.
 nothing sacks boat shel

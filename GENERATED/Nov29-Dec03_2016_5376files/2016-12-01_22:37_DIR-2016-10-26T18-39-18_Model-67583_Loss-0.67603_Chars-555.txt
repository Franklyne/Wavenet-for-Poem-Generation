 WALKING UP IN THE BRINK


as if i like to foreous ridge
 as maddened.
 
the swift
but formal woven is a friending,
black entail could be said? we touch,
 to salt orders i must continued i'm green
 tries just prefigured hours.
it was the far end, but love for rice.


nobody comb planned
in quest stone your red from the land's blood
 holding the grofing end. of one hand called like a route till it, 
another comes across to branches the universal wheat, in savanna's female
and vine-travail wanders

you said omniscient .
i loved like to every look out
 ho

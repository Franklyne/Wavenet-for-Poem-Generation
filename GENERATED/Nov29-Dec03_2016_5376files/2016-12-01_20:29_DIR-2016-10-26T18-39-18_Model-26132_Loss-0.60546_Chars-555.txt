gushing the sun. 

who know the further poem   
and not hin to leave as wall one   

               for the nettled grew with ulus won't do. walk   
feignedities of life in the keys   
perhaps down at bore a holly   
strangers, richards said air, and he- 
he, but god goes in the world higher, a glowing desire davds

          with lye on his bar 

believe, feeding us already clinging,   
legs were strong. yes, i tore   
... we whynotgue, 
                   the night   
to create     so overwhelmed you and canednesded gold.

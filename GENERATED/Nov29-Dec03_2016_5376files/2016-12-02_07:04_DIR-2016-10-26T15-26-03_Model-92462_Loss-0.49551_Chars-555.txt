  IT,


 hover tongues birth
pain. green, revealing,
 backward unpitied,
 of waves wonder, breathes
 makes rigging
 the bird's horn-boy 
  
 an ancient breathing

 buzzing the museum before
 any meeks unravelling two 
 filled faces, severely dead dainting
 just an inches music, and traffic
 holy on, rough as a single light,
  
 the mercury waltz
  
 
i, that's end, or lisbon
 goddamn silk
 in the alarmite had torn
  
 speak
 mirroring each parting palpable
 show
 and sit the words alone for years,
 counts out when i tell her.
 nothing everything about

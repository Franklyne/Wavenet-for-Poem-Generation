 LIFTING GRUBDS AND IF WE WON'T BE MY LEGS


wind, something black flowers upon its heat and people
that toss walled in the orchard of whatever
deemed to the each other. anger after that escape
the stars safely stayed the carnivorous murmur enough
for there scalding thunder. month
of industry pockets and though sepals
and we hear the same expanding.

to the doorway tomorrow's to the leaf wood, the front
caesar, trace the stars running out at them
to paint, a star idiot beneath the skinny
with least mount rest she can't ventured to help myself kids
you

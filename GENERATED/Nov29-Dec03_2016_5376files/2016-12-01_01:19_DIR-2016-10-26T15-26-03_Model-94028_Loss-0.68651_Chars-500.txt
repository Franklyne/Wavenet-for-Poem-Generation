 HAS LORD'S BAD 


a withered arabesques carpet, his dead
witness, sound squeezing everyone is dying,

held at their feet with a scornful bloom,
i was a proven skin is dance.




this stranger only acoustics
the gasoline wings
many kenly white filling we'll steal
so long ago
 calling on this
least as a clamorous
want with the rain should mean
all i can

i sympatheticated me away

the casky room, foliage to you--thursdays fearsome?
i rise that everybody knows--
why nothing but are freque them
around

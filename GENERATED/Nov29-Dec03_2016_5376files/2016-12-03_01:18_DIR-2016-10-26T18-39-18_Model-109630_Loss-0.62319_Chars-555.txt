 EACH OTHERS.


 beautiful jacket as well. 
  
  
  
  
 like islands via -
 let the blood is in the scissors

in the thomphores in a porch, the drapes.
  
 onto the owner
 each nightingales in the walls
they put the dead-decades of ocean's
 open to the backs walking
 and it could say an eternity
 groaning the type-looking
 and on my naked ledger 
 a mouth wanting machines, whirled
like a spoke is this
                                                                        dreams crewed by their long dream.

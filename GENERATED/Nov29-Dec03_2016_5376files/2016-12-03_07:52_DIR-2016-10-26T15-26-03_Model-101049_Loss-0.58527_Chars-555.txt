 YOU, YET HE DARES IT AND INERT CRESTS.


the singers always a manipe, a the impinge,
think's topping with drafts falling lost pregnant cock
on it. small in the prairie club up.
faint of us from my hand faking the moon
to the flame-room whole foaming stillborn in the garden.
 mist of them his end. the swift asks me given me


this is the conveyor that stony craze to them. 
but we're dead then? a mile above.
 you'll never go downs. when it takes in
 the time, hard mosquitoes. all 
 cloves, blond and increasing on the manuscript
 flan into a fallen visio

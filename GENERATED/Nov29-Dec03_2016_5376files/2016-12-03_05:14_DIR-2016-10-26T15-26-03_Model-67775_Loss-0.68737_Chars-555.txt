            AS THIS NATIVE BARE. NOW I LOVE


           as if it were fury 
                             and so that longing.
 the sparrow green most of human streets
 sax juan, and its sargle sock the table 
                                            the waves of ether tension
                                                  of meant blow,
 indians on the frame, the soul
 the table forever.
  
                              and if make moon-hine limbs
  
                                                    and a hand fucking off underside of dying

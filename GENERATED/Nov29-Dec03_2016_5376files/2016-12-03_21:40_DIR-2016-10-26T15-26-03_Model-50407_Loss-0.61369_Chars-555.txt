 DIVINATING


ever such
 free, i am throwing out which we stood in an image 
                    
         and fine might turns
               i am not that? i remember
     
                long the bad jug grows, 
this is the reindeer's head, though pelgriend,
                for no love beyond the day tribes bowed secure. 
        was birds, above, winter than this, calling on my corps
       pride our attic beneath my mother's deceased.
  
                         & nitrac silk by ilk
                                           ever, o the german.

 A PAIR OF SHAPES ON AIR.



a single saying, been gone something wrought
 
now love, an absence and still and falls with a kite, says drank
in the slow enters the sea quarters as to their quarry
without these hands in search of poetry hate and no longer as 
finishing no impocuridity intelligent and chaste.


i think of wood and late emmeshed the exposit in my thigh,
misted in the dark holds itself. the let there.


to know thing, and males and very drive of memory's silence 

neterings, queen man's neck house in a wings   
i hate this your own rain in

 LION


freed all generations, his recounter
be seying a shade
lying. now i'm gone, serene
diapers--where cites 

the deep & the earth
of you, mashingto love.
makes a stopping
there, yes, now discovered--
pick like floor she because

& the delirium--
his arrows . . . my wale mass.
 
like angine
thinking up
the pictures. his perdiamon
     their pride

marks the wounds'
so edges the touch formed
skipping a soul with a night 
of explosive you?
silence
the predclimation 
i'll have a blink
beyond 
abov

 AT CHAINED HERE?


          starling blind roll
glories of wrap
 in well of blue

 a wife till all wright--
 when a few up finds of finally stop 
to married her grows in loxe of place crash, oun pitch theges its peoples 'nwomen down in berrooms go
rain in the wind who wall
                       a why is freeding with ones me
impasted by they lappins
                  or & unplymous. it is arrows under slot,   burnt it were the stone much light.       river, where welt 
the end like the tongue of life.


discued-sand is past far a lovel singing

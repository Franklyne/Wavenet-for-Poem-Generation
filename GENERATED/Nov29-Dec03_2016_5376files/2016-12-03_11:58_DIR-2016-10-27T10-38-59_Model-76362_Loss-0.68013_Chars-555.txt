 AND ARC OR HER BRAINS.


  
 wound awake, to press the chair looks told
 again to bed of the treelin bird.
 of the dark in the jaws and a cat sure you sleep
 when it moan rolled wood for her defibs till he
 then shaken is falling. like beams of proof
 like a parts which walk between the blessing thought

and some saze to the distant and unwept, the ship's lamp 
 under the metal returns wound, keidpe, each and dance
who plugs rape alone
 in the brain crutch futures
 of feelings the strap of the clocks. it full of
 always a star him for a flash of saint

 ALWAYS BASKET EMBARKING FALLS


 even as me as for scar lights untry,
 we were about and the devout nap,
                                 moving tyres.

to the lover table in her eye the unopiator 
climbs babbled dusts the other desire,
     and of stages smoked, their booth? both
 from the steamers, and gave the straited scoregars.


no got to his feign . . . i'll people rocks 
in the images of man's off the tur,
  
 and they are the ocean from the movement accidents fire in a got
 sacket initiside and crying cry
 slowly gravas the girls.

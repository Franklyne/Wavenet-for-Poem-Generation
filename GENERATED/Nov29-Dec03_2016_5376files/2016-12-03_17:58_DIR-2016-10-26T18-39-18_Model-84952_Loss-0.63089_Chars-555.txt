 YOU'RE A SACK OF DAYLIGHT,


 into the sky, and hope if i could take the god, 
then gathered by wet champed behind their pain
 turning the train and wear being boys
that a while, varieties of context.
but the bed, between convinced brine.

i tie augustine, the cowtie can
as if one arms out at times at all.
she feels so your waters and a river
 of ourselves, at nights, undermath
our restless the hummingbirds
when my world wits from it, brushed for.
i drove afraid's caramelize
i hate this peculiar vengeful of depravepticisec.

this is the coffee c posto

 I CAN'T SPEAKABLE


death, rock, guided a kind of bursts and gad
that something blackness with history--

today, where we
mist, or neverthelessness, sky back
we will elaborate batterers, mantelpieces.
i am tried to myself up in the skies
we've known and drives up my coffee
which we used-off i hold you thought it all. 
as the night matter, hard-whom that's how i can't

god to say this huskung destin. 
other was 

heroes east, making sleep when i have sked
crushed door eye in never saw all of town

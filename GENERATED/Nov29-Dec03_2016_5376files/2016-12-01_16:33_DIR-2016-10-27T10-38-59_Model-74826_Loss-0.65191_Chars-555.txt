 MEMORY IS CLEARER THAN PEARLS


the sistern promise the red light look at

in a car landlands with darkness taking sun
as the war things about heartbeat. 
a mess opening the prayers i'm 
with the rend and table my words from the spray nethered flesh.
would others a small so much memory. the mind
the traffic war. there you are a yard

when the widow's soul the father trench
and . . . .

         

this hard the safe smell mark or moves metal town,
with well -- am tranquil indian when lightly
or others and our hoes at the same it grievous pamper my own.

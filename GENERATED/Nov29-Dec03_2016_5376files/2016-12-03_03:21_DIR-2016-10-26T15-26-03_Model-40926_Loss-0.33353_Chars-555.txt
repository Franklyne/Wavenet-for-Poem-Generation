 THINKING 


 who is a chevy everything on. . .
 ice when i shot of you a produce
 whether out the smoldered butes
 i saw out here--young
he felt the wiring out
 of my lap to me
 ripliance, bayonets
. hour help handkerchief
 stands in the pinebula tree
 and cannot
 after all, himself with me love,
 he is required in
 motes burning in the back.
 night is for boredom.
  
  
  
  
 chaff, fate
loudly our mouth of
 the stream

 i have respecter gone--
and drag us
 slumping


 
  
 we knew how i'm learn in the void coming off. 
father. she leaves.

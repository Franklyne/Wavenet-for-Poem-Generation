 GROOVE


we enjoying on the poem 
you don't make my face by wounded
in its sounds, which he is after flesh
but one of you are love on,
dunk who fishes to be interior
your lives & research for seven years 
just homes closes
around chyllas, disguised, 
granite me a hill, thoughts
of president who

arms big boys 
when i used
hours hand 
doom'd. you.

the
the tawny
words
risk...lit ceres

i ask him
you are little
is drive said nothing
do no
have faint power
heart see
that's on the reasoning

over my life
my single gray sappho ombien
skin off on pine
form

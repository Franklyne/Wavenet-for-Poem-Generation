the one who had looking at the world?
alien flashlights.


native old steady habit 
looking on your mind
death on hint 

ats free wendolish
the angelsioy prince, it ends
to castable
feeds that i have gired
by a day
wh sloth with living bough

the air huts at bends pogolof
under myself
and heart-heated of a door


the thing, even
that one here--pound
beneath a wall
who can enter the less,

but then take snags
o sashes,
                                                                    i was by talisman
 ddrendor,

often sponge to produce

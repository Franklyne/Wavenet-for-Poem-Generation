 HOUSE TOO MULTITUDE


 whose eyes to kill you,
 only the crooked porch,
 southwards of
a bucketful show threads
 the beauty our bed,
i know by the same old
by my gardens of afterwards of hubris that watch
which, careful strand off moves 
  

. we look out hope and lighted starting across
 the tree day's entertainment island
  
  
 but brushes when didn't remedy cities
 air this grey to be out
 be obliged if it
 who was from a circle, standing
 clothe at the plrading ptintboom, the prepare to fame

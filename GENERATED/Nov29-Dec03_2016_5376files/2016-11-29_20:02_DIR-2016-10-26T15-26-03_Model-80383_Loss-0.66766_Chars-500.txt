 HONEY-BREAKING-OPE 


i have sung to you
                            a dual city of thee.

ask me think how you said the tuft
the heart slab. i came back, 
whose kids not wielded 

they shook you upon the paths 
who howl?   we are not to scream. 

            some down, death, and groing. 
             square, thrustup
                                          the oh good at earth loved near 
and as a slow as gran & cease answering 

                                 flesh

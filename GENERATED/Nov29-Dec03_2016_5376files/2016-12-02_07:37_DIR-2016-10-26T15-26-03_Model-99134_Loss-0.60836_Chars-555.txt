 OF EVERY LAUREAN AS PAIN, 


             sins 
still, or thy comfort. 
   and then we say upon bear
                              but within he want. 
               to make no empire, 
the balance of bloom to one emergence 
    so.  
                                                 
                        something yours
                             
                sweet beams or source, 
               from the clock flaunt 

                  down upon your time 
                    and sings, one night 
                          but eacht

 IN MEMORY.


the beloved voice glued and look, we. mirage
constructed
today where he is a neighbor 
or the worldly dawn. i ammunia that they wick.
a sad a monument.

dig down by the work.
--no compassaded to me,
damn and go. cover is deeps.
then what there was no glass word   
we scream in the time
at the rutted wrestling.
only when we used more bounds
and in my refrain languages,
for as speak in a grace
droops box everyone hour
denizen song. she's a passion up 
into tuberculosis 
pink was the mood out in the day
to look up, with a child's hollow eyes

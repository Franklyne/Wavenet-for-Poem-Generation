 THE SUN, 


the smoke and souls shiverses under with fetters, 
hrone on the world's whole event 
out of our forest than ground for delight 
upon a radio sounding edge. 
he did not have to sing. 
as if to hold the obligation schooner 
from the moon horizon and sage, 
leaf young like drops of last or baby no way 
to pool the trick of the open into it, 
closed or glume-up and for a lichen,   
and i sing on the ungainly poems,
as where at the middle age 
all his thought eat at the novel by wash, 
and

 OF THAT D'EVRAN WITH THE WAY COMING 



and the eyes of prayer from all the translations 
distance of light


i held in bronze a man who 
kings 

words on an orphaned around wrists 
acts our matron who crabab the questions.



before my head another calls up 
to person. and the intentions

for poem handsman and the yellow require values hunkers   
the skull schemates looning the brilliant saar 
alas blossom is there exquisite horse than poetry 
whoebind an airplanes bags cumming gutsk 
told him strands 
she could you and it 

   if any she was happy.

waywardrove the phantom,
i piled your rousted hobbies as wine,
a thrown hair the body ancestories across the beams of life the titans caress   
over the people at the angel of spring,
so having her wiligenonomics
destroy to see mysticity
very seliomer is
keep dwi sit with an axe--
my skinship napkins blood and despaired

it's a liquid like a picture of wax.
  sent in


on seven my errora 

i overpowered by knowing the grandeur &
corridors boats 
word song, 
bones suddenly

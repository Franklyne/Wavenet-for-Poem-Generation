                 MY TOAST,


 and loves the phosphorescens.
  
 o what of cars folded gesture

are poetry brains untouched in compassion,
say, lodges free the hand listlessness,
our backs no one park on that my
                                                  
                 the threat you letter
          thoughts hated still thing your neck, . .   
                                                                                           awake, footstepping her with fruit.

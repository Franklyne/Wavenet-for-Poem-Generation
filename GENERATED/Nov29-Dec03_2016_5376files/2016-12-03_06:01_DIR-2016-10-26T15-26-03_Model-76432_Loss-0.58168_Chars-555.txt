 I MUST FINE WITH YOU


thoughts, if i running in a sheltery.

how i want told the same in
which the sloves of the fist
of hands materia,
dear corners much less.
or as a month, 
poking about bright
before 
toiletto shakes a letter that my hearse
in the balletroom, then
music i enter the flat
man splitting into woolworth.
who said before my.
this abundana and coming. this blood, 
the milky ghost age brandy
deeply razzle boy the machine

a pale on the willow shaven,
echoes nobody and square wood.
even the divisibility in our conspirable
my biograph loose

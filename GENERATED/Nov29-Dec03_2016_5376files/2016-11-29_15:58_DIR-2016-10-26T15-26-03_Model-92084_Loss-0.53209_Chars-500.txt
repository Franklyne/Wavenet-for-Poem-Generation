 waltz 

across the passing of  roses floating and plains upquestion, 
will i zigzagged a thought
or the just i thunder 
you cost a chip still by women makes my father praise pearls about the paper
like what meant evenings, signs people closed, finger--the feathers taken my mouth lold, 
we overlook even of quadruting to myself for being morning?
then shadows were my cap, and the sea,
and from two
and they all sparkled the sun, you didn't wear?


if-to-move creator, a cell constantly
beautiful nat

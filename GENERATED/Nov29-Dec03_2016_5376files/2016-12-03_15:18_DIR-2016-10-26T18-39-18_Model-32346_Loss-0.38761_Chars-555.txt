 SETTOSPHERE. WE FINAL THE NIGHT,


once in hunger it brought the ged passage
 another. i push myself at spring
 as attendant of missing winds advantage
 and ringing its ships with the produces
       bsychologist.snuffles,
or rise as a cok a second as this
 back.
  
 holy must passion to be perfect i dreams
 a poem of a treasure.
  
 do to him worded.
 to catch being pick up the words his embers
 bottles with vermouthing
 when i think it fields up in horsebank
                              couch cherokee
 between the man
            never before words

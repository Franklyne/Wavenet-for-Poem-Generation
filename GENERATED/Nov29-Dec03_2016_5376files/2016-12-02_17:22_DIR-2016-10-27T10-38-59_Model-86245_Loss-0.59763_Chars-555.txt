 BLOOD 


he rose, blows-eyed, then we sleep off   
of the couple in my mouth store   
o after one part of straight venice   
or ever a tonal thing   really 

my silence new back from 
fixing over still spikes 
echoes at his forever felt the lord, 

as a heavenly glittering naked 
burned--he'll find it   
like the suburban water a ghost two men,   
housews gleaming, rule not photo   
real carex of familiar,   
cupprovs them these verses 
will come from anything. 
the pane that it ball-- 
around you made   
home 
machine, tilted down, 
i lizzie's dimple

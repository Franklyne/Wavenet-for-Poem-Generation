 EAST


with a slugger out. barkhand our names we've come back in.

      ii
with a grave one like a fish
never be and wilded by the squirment.

i ask for months in gray cap
children slowly one

desire, luminary. mural
death --

tongues apont that spum. shoes by.

but food from the one-eyed lodged
where the sacred promises or ground
in clara

on november
show
shows we were the same lamp-garden wing
deliberate people with
seeds when i arrive.
i am still a stand jaw

as death's stony books

you jesus, while never to send the noise to buy its leaving.

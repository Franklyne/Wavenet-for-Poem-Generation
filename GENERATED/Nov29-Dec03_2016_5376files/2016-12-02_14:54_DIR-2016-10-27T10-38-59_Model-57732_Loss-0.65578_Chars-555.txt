 US. I AM KEATS & A SPINES DANCING


or carrying cheaters tipped to the need
of the flood cookie understand
life and gleanout the soft, my glow shoes
in unison life, i then someone 
for suspect, knowledget divides into my head
fate utter the hissing devastation, 
crime never lost we should gaily  
ready to be empty begotten the pond's wood's 
watched the water that first into my right,
so dry, despair thoroughfares so vanished--
everthorns of heaven & lord--
leans its land of being lungs for bell.

taking my griefs vein, some rose can.

                HALF-LIGHT I WAS LIVID,


                                                         playing underbird me in the field wind.
             i knew the birds from memory. and white girl 
                                       the world is his--through 
                     the two-letters of the scene.
                                 to be chaunt the usury on their own,
                         to one care of thousand view in the
                                   marble and fathers 
                                         and all the days

   tokay the patches of the silver express
 beside the hymn rails on dryer 
     and lit fists could not

     kilome the new yorker
      no water or desaisu even
 without a rather fit it.
       that might sweethed shut andersign
          
 or wounding by hours a risk that fednes,
          this i had endure

        me are save the praining sang,
       and stared at-alls
     i am tho' god bizard'd

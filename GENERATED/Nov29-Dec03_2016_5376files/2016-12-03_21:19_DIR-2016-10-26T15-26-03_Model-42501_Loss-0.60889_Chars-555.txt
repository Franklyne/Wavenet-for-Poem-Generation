 I SAW 


famished
our father, the solo fists and sex so strong
sings of one. and hoe. i said
her phosphors & returns and all the world.

since i
said that i had they
in the grass
moved at a bundle 
said branches.

and where you are
your spit men sharp them cultivats to thank
they wondered in the same you see
a small towing in one's there?
imprisoned hair, we curse into the incandescent.

the man kills they pick just thinking


the wolf's trine opens that they don't salt?
they know. what i should live of the overgrown shore, 
historic spits.
the sheep

 SOONER THE PEOPLE,


and the dock sad sky insects - charm
 was bearing the narration blossom rover hooks
while i am into the end of my folkan winter
   refused the hours pivoting in sums,
by the outside slabs, the fields all my rolle for a frequency,
 the pond & their eyes that what hoj owl night,
a puzzle with shoulder we wake in my time
whose degree something news in one day and sky to love it the, 
most even the feelings of her hands and that autumn with dust, if the highway,
we pause--as asham

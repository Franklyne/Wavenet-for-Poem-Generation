 BELIEVE AUTUMN PLASTIC AND SLUDGING TO          NOT BE PARADISE.  


old soul, you hear her to say what we move. 



let me a smoking birdboy--a retropettea. 


a common my nero and platinum   
of rot of things down of out    among the sun   
burned--cinex--waiting smiles twirling chest   
with an end of the hill prisoner's pure bill to them----   
for breathe sweets high pumpkins or months   
that makes no one's easy up, fiena, it's peace   
crystal, and where he cup and star  into the deludeity. 
in the corner and aspirin suicide. 
i drive the size

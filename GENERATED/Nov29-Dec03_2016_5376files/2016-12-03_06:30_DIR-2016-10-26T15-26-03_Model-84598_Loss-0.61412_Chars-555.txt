    REST,


of wind my life blotched to the 

in the furnace in a summers' zooe glove floor
why is causeway of my friend
light the leaves are so bulging. we 
wound, haping garlands of sorrow.
          severed by very levels--
oh, thoughts are not a year afternoon flem
except for quiet world who were covenant, 
delight with so much happy its bridges 
i felt him to greens and lius all around
my house on the notions to life the courty's andan, 
            really respecters brushed

                 prospered ground--
                           sweer

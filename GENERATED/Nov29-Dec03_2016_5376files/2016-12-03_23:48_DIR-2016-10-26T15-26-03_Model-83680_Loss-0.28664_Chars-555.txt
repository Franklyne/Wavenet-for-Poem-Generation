 INTO THE MIDDLE MORROW 



worthy soldier's quickly, in cows
when i'll hem you in.
i sat taken where we dance, as if he squeezed for fiddle not 
all the light
takes a snapshocks creditus, 
the memory trees to invective
itself. it was dead at our circling. 
but it was down that comes a final men
at twelve our wound, which can't
make it to be rich, athela 
my first cars ablaze, for those or fear
i would praise there are these faces
this breaks innocent calm. 
the stairway trees to take life 
would chinatowel king, i mean the south stales, 
blackmakes us

 AROUND THEIR TONGUES


      when man's rait, from the corner-a miles.

from this greater in front of the air 

comes a conforming as brain with swip
away slumps like morning, stared, dust undressing 
 
 they got glances from club after rip and blazons,   
a tiny had just speaking the imagination.


for a flock of being as etching ovens 
labyrinth of stars, the skyscraper's plain
you go

boring the liquid biose then you the weathern 

subway it's larger, standing toward simply, 
perhaps schoolmarming fear loops. we know we're no more,
a little slacks

              buckle who waiting them
you to shines           the other typs it
the wans, replayed by loverslumbool
as a thousand and silhouettes to the day
& the dead into a pittoon, 
                    despite an electro and skirt

and ride blue still put clean
seat they are gave wadericize the flood
the red in a dogs season literation
the wanese--i always from the bark

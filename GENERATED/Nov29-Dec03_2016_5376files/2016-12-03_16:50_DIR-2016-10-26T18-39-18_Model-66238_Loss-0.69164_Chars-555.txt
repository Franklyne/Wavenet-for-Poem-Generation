 TONE LAUGHED AN ETCHEW


and bound it ever try to end
deep-time my bed athirst           here they went the climes
with dream of red lack of wisdom tube my last 

the facts i rains over walked through letting

more than a negatives from the eart it
the pale at borderdi explore still? and
the angelws of blue eyes on the earth
the ground
great child of a morning
a memory with a sound nest.

what element team of the pavement fags
needles, cleared in your naked in
in a last hang
why should my case of side
god was too fades
as his strue . though i not
walk

 INADVERT


your steppered counted down and determination freeze

merlins bleaching. by there were don't there touch,
to carve unknown her desk, straces, seeing. 

we wait for all the big by time the angels 
fingers and the king.
 
across the dimmed virginiating calls. a teaus
without sill with impartially lust for the bucket flux.
he handed and tight this is being so much less the churn.
they said, i'm a crowbar, during the cock's rancid brought me
of the sun god, splash of things,
the orient years inside pearl
slap me as complex of thing
with my head

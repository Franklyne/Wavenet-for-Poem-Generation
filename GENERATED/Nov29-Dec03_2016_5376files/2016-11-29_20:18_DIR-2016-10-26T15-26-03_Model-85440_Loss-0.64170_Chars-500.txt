 SWEET THEY TEND YOU


                                        come pain
and watched through me it will grow
                                              oh circuit waves are open you.  as ghosts, disgust
  the silk 
                           get the sky that is partake taste rightens

on voracious animals unstinct,                        a gust of soon, and wrappers of feathery, & berlum,
five-year of clause.
with those who tells you were born. here
places, fireweedy babe inside me dumb sheathed

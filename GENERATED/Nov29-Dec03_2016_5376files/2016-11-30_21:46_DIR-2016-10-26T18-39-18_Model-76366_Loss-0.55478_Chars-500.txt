lost moves are two pin of our blues goes
starting a smiled. where the hay a scout,
 the ins till was like boys 
it bair-wrail, a field, a gymoveesed vanillay
 the undefined lick the show when i was 
 the dead magpies diamonds, crispus, nor
 it was getting if you looked and drizzle
 the way it in, but dark into have
 the golden from the stolen plymouth their necks 
white station mussel. in a tilt no one at the glimmer in the cup of sleeve
fleeing against the ichor of the golgothas of leg
magnoli

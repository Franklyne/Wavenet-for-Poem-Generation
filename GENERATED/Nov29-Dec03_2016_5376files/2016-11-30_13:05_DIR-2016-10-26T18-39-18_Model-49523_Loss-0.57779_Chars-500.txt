 WEEKS, THAT ONLY LIGHT CYCLE


 down the detonation, door. under the bower
 a dark, nothing but i've not to live with and a gulf
    silent cost and trees around around the space 
 loved my honest in their caat dorist, his up
                         at the numbers, and i called snow.

 staring thin boots to musicble depth
 dilight, frost. junior moon. you cannot be the ebb of dreams.
              exered is
              the ryeyed unclean stone winter magen

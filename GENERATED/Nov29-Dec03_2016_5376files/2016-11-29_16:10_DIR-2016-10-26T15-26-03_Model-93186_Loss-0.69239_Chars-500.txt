 a-blue window stays hold embrace. prequence and no team
                                   on the eye
  
               not ice, thou wast ours.
                                                   change
                             weep 
 
                                                      drawn away, notice
& sand even processes 
on what we shall see that he stands it. and in.
the night bat is king for my fame,
peace of my definition or not-suite
--
being to this one in the doors

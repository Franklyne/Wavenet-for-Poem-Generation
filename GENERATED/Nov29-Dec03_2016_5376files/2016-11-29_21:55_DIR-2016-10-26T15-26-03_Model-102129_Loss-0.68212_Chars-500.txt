 HER FINGERS,


 light was at christmas. celestial and men with the extremities
 have you bathed i have to understand i will have,
 far before for the december of men to the fight
 walk its headstone reies between my loved grass.
 intellects come flat apartment on my long
 of drink as the nester public growing and live
 in the ghosts rings and coat and savagery flutes 
 give us betune in the quality music and london trees,
 so beautiful sleepovelence out sick with the decenter
 we learn to my angel

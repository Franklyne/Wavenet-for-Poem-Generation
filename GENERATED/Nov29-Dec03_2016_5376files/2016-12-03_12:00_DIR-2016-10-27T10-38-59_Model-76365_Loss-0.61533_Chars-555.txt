 PHLEGM IN LANGUAGE ROOM.


  
 bending in the belly nur weeping money contgons
on a grade, fill the second dress,
 leece to displaced out. i sat beseeks
 but now i begin to paint out. burn the world
 guttering through ballets meaning a poet 
of arch of like a hero's maws the blues.
constant across a chevy pale the meat
on the mind communion, it seems without end?
the tenth man and lack of her virtue is
fire and sea-honeyed harmless an idea.
see her unsmooth corporates
they points our discoss up.
water sowed to believe there's raucous
and the white sag

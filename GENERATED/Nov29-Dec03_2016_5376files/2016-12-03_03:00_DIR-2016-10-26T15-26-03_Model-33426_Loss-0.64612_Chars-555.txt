 STONE'S


a cloistral iron father roar.


i rested in boracian black hard-the- 
the long treasure.
 bread


with shaved ghost
straddle to kill my cornership.
the saints and sun.


where the woung
    in stataary spirit,
and wool and slaked
 and souve anytime.

              and around the sup of eviee?
scattered things & tex reading up
         the hameless didn't balanced
 
illimity i'll live in the wall
      you bound photographs
 .
 for jumps
         you said soft
  
         a cikteen wedding wire
  
 resemblance i mean worry,
 so i'll mist walk

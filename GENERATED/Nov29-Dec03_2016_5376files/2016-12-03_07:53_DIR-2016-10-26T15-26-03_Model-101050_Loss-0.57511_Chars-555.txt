 WIND AND


instinct's for me too.
 i'm always poems,
  
                        it
                                  their children.

                                                                   seemed to edging
              intermitted blanket, unflawed
 the greeks markets
                your strength and crafts,
               like flames
                   that went out before,
 where you see it to
  
                  with my zified plastic
               the narrows
               the snails dance like a screwball
 boldblocks you impulse,

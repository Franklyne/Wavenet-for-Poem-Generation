 AND


 i tugged out, bare smell 
eight you become too

match we don't let your hand
without imitate of sight.
 
so easy time i knew blue mourn in ownue.




how many ur, the tree. a table land
 venerations qualities from spars 
so everything cool gate 
meat, i've heard me wouldn't write my door
 smiling to say i still stage--another in maid
do you had the again-white hand
give years making them why it was,

                                

complicity and w's own dispense you and rude soft caring
                         she runs to stay over you

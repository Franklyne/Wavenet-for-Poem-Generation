well this poem. not the very owns .
  
 it pays by speaking me to ass
 in alashness-legged me--
 
  
  
 mocking events amateurs marshes
  
 the chimneys on the hill.
  
 say, what we were bright be,
woman's eyes or ghastly night rust 
gleaned over that i swore of
 the annual work.
 that's that she melt drifts
 visibles his world
 feathering sleeping

& busy to my former dyed. and its own two white,

twice footsteps -about
the wind entrance of crossroads,
 solutions, till the bright beyond

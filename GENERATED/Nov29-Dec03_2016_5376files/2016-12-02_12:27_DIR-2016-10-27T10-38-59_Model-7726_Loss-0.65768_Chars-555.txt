 GROWN BENT WHOSE DRY RAILS HIS BODY BLINDS  HEAD-


the longer very follow yes corn, soon answurs
broken in a little the ground
enter the ears with a pour to its poets of inrums
to ceaving me hold, which snow,
and listles scathered petalple on a pel pretender

 little connects of me them. atop hoars intersmashed sea.
the self here visual will some to be on the wind.

for live this boy sapling stoppers skin sulsets to the wind.

for years ago                                              over stood it just pail?

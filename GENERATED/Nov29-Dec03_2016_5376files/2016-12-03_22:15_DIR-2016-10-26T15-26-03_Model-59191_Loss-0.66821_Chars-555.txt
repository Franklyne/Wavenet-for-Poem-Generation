 O'ER THEY HAVE HAMPERED WE'D BE


 a reservoire makes their shadows of things
 i walk them under the numb,
 ignorant hmicy and long,
 then death is only the drumming by the backyard,
 whose glory is worshipful in my mind?
  
 nobody paths asked us, the first music,
 which it feel the ideas or picked.
 silence shadows down in the front use,
 but i hope. the moon shall be
 of the sound-bark hand complete down. 
  
 souping hand she bears money
 then on my patsonal genius
 the smartin tears, there the flaring of enchanter,
 jumbling for a mile in the art

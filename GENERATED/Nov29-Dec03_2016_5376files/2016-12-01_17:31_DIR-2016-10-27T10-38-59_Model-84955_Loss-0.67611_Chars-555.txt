the weather-in-andics brilliant elbow in short.
 wipe to ask susable proportion of the skies the strummed
 of the stonin yet to reach the thirty year.
 still, why i took the only heaters well--
 of the office men in the bud of people
 all natures with canyon sketch of fence
 and blind each other bark hearth            these

 place in the air while tired 
        the rhythm to do awake my fireball,
 hammer an agea.

       see lives and lives as there,

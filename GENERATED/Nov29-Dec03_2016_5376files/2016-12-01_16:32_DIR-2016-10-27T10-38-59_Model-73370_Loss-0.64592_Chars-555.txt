 CREATURES FILLED ME, 


         for i for foe. 

.  while we kiss a fine went batteries 
                     and then we courted wood

 shall weighs, and dismantled my song.


                        
much canst thy pink, the pain 
      an' hirded away all articles 
and with his mercy steal air wings, 
              derichon to the hills 
sweetly pretty that sounds were grow 

with wanders of their carons rubbed a toph
   a clock machinery is honey 
nor with you to the command, blend, with the brim, 
               striding on my face

 CARCASS


 between the floor we live wildflower that was a labor.
my dreams, someone the room, or ignise, but mostly--wife black pumped through,
a head for the bicycle? unimportant glove, likely lions and suspecting
 or barneum in poems away what is you're the road, give
 my furious mold nint. again--chair stops has enters, until their tinctions. 
everyone green into eye a christmas to seconds the end good prize 

appalls and basking of a yellow, stiff within it,
escaping me to my mouth in the care to them
to see thoughts, and it que ghosts like you

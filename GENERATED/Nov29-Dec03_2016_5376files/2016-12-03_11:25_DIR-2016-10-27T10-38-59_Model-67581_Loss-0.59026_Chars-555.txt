 REMEMBRANCE, CRYING


 now you in the asphalt slide  much a green
 after a poet emotions. the taller
 was butter, a fire. we
move each other since againsthai
 aflet it
a wandering that is plain.
that durell me you're still, 
the left unreasonably be these
 to have it.
years of misoearaans we smarter
i sleep again the king
where my inventioned land off 
 wind from the ranks of soul and the self,
 began to crave in pilgrim of shoe. 

perch too long, after.

it was, wrote alone easily. bend boom in time 
their shut in the sun as for bapting
of thin glass

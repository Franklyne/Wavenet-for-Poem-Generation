 ON THE REST 


   to fall that perfect nor lose the light, 
    that heaven fall no worlds to wait. 

on tonight dark moving in your dreaming sun, 
and indeed the windows where 'em, no quiver woe 
that too find our heart not been excellent. 
as for a part of bonquire rains on the knives 
                                                 to speak 
    when they are, as risk. 


gold thyself to reach unobscuring thoughtst   
       could not die against the joys.

                                             behr. 
the death is o'ergging me only po't

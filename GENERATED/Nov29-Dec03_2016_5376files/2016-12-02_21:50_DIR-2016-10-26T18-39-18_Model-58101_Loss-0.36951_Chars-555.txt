 LOVE--


  
  
 the sun bird boreals.
  
 halves me the force is also attraction, bells vanishing
 it has no face. the shadow of all whose ancestors,
 the seraphs are the happier drast forever?
 with water's motionless perhaps, mupilet grand,
 that three like the glimpse, creators, on air.
 why coloring coral in agreed beads     yes window
 a strange singers, such a soul is true dangeries
 rooding pudgy in draped vivace holy holy the same.
  
 the smelly grains, he burn to cat. yes
 when our stony of windows from, brittle, i knew not headacheries on,

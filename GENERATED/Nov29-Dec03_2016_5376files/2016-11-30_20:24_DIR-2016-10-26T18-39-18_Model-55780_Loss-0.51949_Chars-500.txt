 GOING BANK, YOU ARE DEATHSFURS 


of the resolut-segarious slip 
or him who looked lambent at the roots 
to make sneeze of new spongestion shells   
waiting is to forever lined april part of the bourne, 
a greens undergroundiff 
his heart chased under a week in years ago. 

he really lines, to the hollymako, everyone knock them.

at smoke the intensely brief so do you will. 

coppery nation mirror on limposed velvet 

you have fear to owen, 

you feel even rain. 

have no winter like from itself

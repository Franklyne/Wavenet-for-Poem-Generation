 INSTANT WITH NOTHINGS, 


a nap is manipulature, when you
man you locked
alone birds half-buttering
the husk when my low reaching again? i didn't
like the fields
in a fool.



a sheet worker
the hiven
in the end,

let there's the eye of the clear nood
everywherever 
i prayed for past a cumulu
singing. still? 
you said i've learn
the better

come, double-year


daynoy do you grow, 
in sleepy force how pesel
the sound of dear

then what's how i don't run

a fling 
mother fand months hesitation
at blows in the mountains 
thoughts i was bottom
nor passing

 DREW AWAY FRIEND,


 the preventable called against the stars.
  
 seems through mysterious labour glass
 the life is in the perimeter's death-out escape,
  
 but once the stranguines

  
 


streets. in for the moon, foxs. little glee 
 among sky folks the lovers made of the arcs
 as if someone attraction where a birt.
  
   
 reckles against the snow pains, cellular,
  
 empty, motes and by band, only beats
 instead of the stoves i have peeled my ache
  
 vision a canvas, its leaves of the cable

that this griddened the brains. earth, 
 there is not

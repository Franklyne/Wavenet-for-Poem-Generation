    BUT NOT TO MEAN


 your weeds, boom
 repeats of a baseball's,
 each had limb being it kissing.
  
 the page of death oklahoma
  
 i am standing in sweat and certegon
 her pipes in love, forteores
 nobody leaving, once a monotone, mispoke
 insaw. he'd to thee, or the stove,
 waves on.
  
 a tree story corridors over the doom.
  
  
 iii.
 try trading it in the tip of the champ
 
 severed by a lover's force
 falling does not not prezame myself who drunk
 a hasek he grips our vines and grimace rememberence.
 you loved with their muzzle tongues of love

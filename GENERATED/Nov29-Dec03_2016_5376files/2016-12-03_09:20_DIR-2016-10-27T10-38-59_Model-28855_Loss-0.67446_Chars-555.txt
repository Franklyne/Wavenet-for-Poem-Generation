 HEART NOT KNOW IT ENMESH 


while ride air
hangs out of your beautiful 
not had silences,
till i was hanged from a fence a defeat   
and ever none they saw 
and full the floor 
of snow the back is on, cold 
back the grass perfect hearth sway. 

goe sbetton rico behind them drown'd make 
they were the familiar into sudim find 
their off-springs the man 
of a benefice of the bin curls 
keep through the shores with their blood 
of the tall of the bat. it is crawled 
down over its blushama all the oil 

another stays your drop out on
so beauty he can hear

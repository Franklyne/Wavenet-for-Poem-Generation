 OR DUST, THE YARDS.


 come
  
  
  
                            the suppregnant,
           puzzled splits have flower?
  
  
 i ever rise each in doubt.
 a fourth only as time to say.
the stript, heard then, and their palms
before i could seek green.
 last night is your friend

                   deathless past sail
  
 holy the granddadding

 paised like little fizzlin?
  
 or so we find them  or crisscross
holding frost and all night,
 and the hopes told behavior
 miles of maple coats.
  
 like a captains are ashamed and

  
 on the zinter bekeill

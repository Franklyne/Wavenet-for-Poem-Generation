 A WORLD OR ASH THE PATH,


october is getting along.
  
 oh i dreamed the stiff root fire,
which meets that so long, children the,
     unless its own for anymore
 is cool has walking is weavey.


i stood written
 from the house my eyes run tritic

do you knew it is, banged for love leaves costumes

for hours and herbs flung by, the stairs
in the old unraveller tenderable the
 and while we were made answerge than small sentences.

on the wound
while on both the judahites we were afraid.

i

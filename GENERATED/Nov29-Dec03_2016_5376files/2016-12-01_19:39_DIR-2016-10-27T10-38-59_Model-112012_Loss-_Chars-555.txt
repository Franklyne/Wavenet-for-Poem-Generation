 EVERY WINE  


pushed our hearts the blare of deserted,   
and artered the live oak as a truck of 
    in the god pang hanging the lune   
you went out--niece oubli predictable 
     upon a tawdrine up destined by light 
       in philadelphia our own hands from her girl   
of my dancing something of what shines everywhere   
    a questionable just not wait 
                                                   flowing up in pocket   
were saying through london in the other years ago,

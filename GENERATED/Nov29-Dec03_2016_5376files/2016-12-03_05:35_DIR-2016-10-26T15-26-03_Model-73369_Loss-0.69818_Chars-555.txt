 JOY CLOUDS CLINGING 


stunt me restless, gives of their veils, swift   
ah     from a word, that wretched a buds, as will, 
so many a young foul beg that flower thou art, but   
who hath me have no attempts and sun-floors 
but nature the upper united hooks from thee. 


                                           then we were 
      dear lowest thy glories with yew days 
      th'eter we do shall come she none of you, 
    how much we shall find thoughts which is most 
    then a pirogue, upon the salleys, my parting, 
   our best harden.

 HIS HAUNCHES   


would get the bison in full sit   
i would 
it felt confuses are head,   
if nothing keep keep and duh   
how lought the wind into it 
toke her legs unth. 

wind 

i go and its own how it seem don't 
without him where it hurts 
and the first shady drive   
within the weeds we keep 
that night sick lodge, time   
sniffing swords   
seem the adustriver, 
our eyes for winter 

on move. in the house air to go 
the least exhalation, a fair pooh-riser,   
heart. 


time coming on tru'c

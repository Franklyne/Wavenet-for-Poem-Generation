 QUEENS YOUR MOTHER, 


       other summer yon bliss blesses, god, 
his armored cheers a ball of treacherous base, 
beats outsitt about to climb a little tears, 
and all his hurt might a whole on living with shape 
my whale drive unknown two stilted, not spy
believing i sat, and balmy as not de, 
and the frozen calm dens had found 
heart whom ye seemed away with from wind, 
they, down the reign, fluttered not.

 SECURITY TO MY


sacrilegions, the paper and heights who should tell
you this.
 like bst lion glows holding sleeps
spend strikes drumming ashorehead,
and white tentacular
pretzed
 that sock-baguste  wrack, 
infuriating
the green glazing in the night, 
ne icicles will into the dread.
the moon would loop, like
smoked on iris a no more--
everyone with my iron cream
like to teared
remember it streaming only
down through the knife
of the coast, dim
of the background she did myself
their comrades will world as fastos
like twined and selves, the toys
of debi

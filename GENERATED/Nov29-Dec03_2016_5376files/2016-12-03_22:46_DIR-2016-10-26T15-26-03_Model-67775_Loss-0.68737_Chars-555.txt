 SUNDREDS OUT THEM


the world on the sea wounded back the lixens.
the way a shirt, act when these conventions
soak and more breasts glide o'arts
when i scarce the street lambs
playing i want to dry-living.

the rouse of the thicket
if i am. barbiturated
this chamberlain she creases.
i look at once doubt.
i barely waiting,
amphit at you.
i move. knew.
why'd known to give.



his travis limbs after all i'm hiding myself,
or county, take-
'tis to his
wound swore 
when one hundred moon
and crawling flicker.
bus so the fifth strikes,
temped over then open

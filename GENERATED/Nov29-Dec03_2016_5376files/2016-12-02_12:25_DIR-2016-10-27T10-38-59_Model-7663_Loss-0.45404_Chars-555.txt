 WRAP IN A STRAP,


 their own. you at the constants
 strill glance bunch

of manhattems in the sun-sea cows and a hand-spares'  
             with their rush
of hiss skin babd. they the long verimmed
the subward through the canaronda welled
 the wender to see the dusts of the tea-
the trouble can in men over the men sealed
  
 lugging mile yellow             there is the table
                      all contrary.
            west, every burol
 the wind the rops the very
 p.idies, few the water the kinds
in front and lambdids

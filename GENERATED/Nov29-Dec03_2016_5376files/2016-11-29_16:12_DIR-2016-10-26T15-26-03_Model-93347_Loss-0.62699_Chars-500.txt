 i was losing it?
                                               

thunches . . . who knew. you're how, i get free 
part to drain off by mile and son-
                                                                                                                       its cot, lord
 it is like myself daddy, 

how do you catch my crumbs from me--
love later, jettison souls out effections.
some back interjects, a store of flattery, 
if the world we find and answer as a mirror
their screeching fiel

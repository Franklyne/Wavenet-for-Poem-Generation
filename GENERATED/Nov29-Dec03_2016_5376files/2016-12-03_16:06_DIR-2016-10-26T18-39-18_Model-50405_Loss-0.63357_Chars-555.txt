 PAINTING, 


who won't turn of slavia, cin,
 turned the gate, the sky,
you
 this wedding-in-

common are flesh i'd like
gesture-moved into dropped
throw is not ines.


postcard up over to not stream
 makes its own coughing
 virtue's the sun.
its home
 into the bad,
opened a prayer
and beautiful, to a woman,
outwitting the twilight 
turn we are breakfasts arthrittened,
for happy was torso, carpark,
until you are ready to end of american structure--
and she said. not a rosecro and iriss
that no, it is like a mile the joke
in your pathetic behalf lurking

 BENT GIVE LANDING


 the snowflake willow i saw flippy not read to the old, 
supping my tongue, by and there a hand
  
  
 false when noised the pinnaway to petals --

galley too warm taste iron sunday is getting croaks 
his pew deepens seas set just,
    appenlin about this fast
b unleash opening, experience--our off 
only on a spoon meat we vesser      to writes and banish
 cobb view toward thurmorse magic than head,
standing short, thoughts live. i never engage chisel on straps,
fecrasing color again.
for beauty was eed. i have,
we have we could ..

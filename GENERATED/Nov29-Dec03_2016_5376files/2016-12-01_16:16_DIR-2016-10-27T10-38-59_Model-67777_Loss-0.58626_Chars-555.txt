 LIGHT BENEATH THE COD-


 of patient dust
 and small as another tin a pool
 that there is a team from breath
 and yet i barely by the centuries
 a fast. bricks peace themselves
 holding the senses of sweat 
twenty years last years
in the morning in the road,
 i talked about me, the earth.

the old man struck as it used
as we were in, where ponds
 i am now i undersky. no shanty.
what i might's impiously 
idol onto i read 
chatty, when i wrote the tidal sigh
 was. who smiled the past where 
the night wind of fame,
 as i read the answering easter

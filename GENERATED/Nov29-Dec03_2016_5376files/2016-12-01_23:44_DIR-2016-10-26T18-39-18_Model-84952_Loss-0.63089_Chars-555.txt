 RECOGNITIONS ON ICE.


  
 laughing hand me watched their nectar
  
 in their daily great appeased 
in the negative. a kite as the loom
he walk on narcissus so bright as elevators
has never can come armades into right,
they means of now. something instant
she told her tickets of the groan
in a sad in umbrella weather hand,
on my hand on things to these
 fifteen to avoid the juice chickens,
the only waiting for good.
  
                                               stone
  --mountains when lost
  
                 upon the state of her sharp his bag?

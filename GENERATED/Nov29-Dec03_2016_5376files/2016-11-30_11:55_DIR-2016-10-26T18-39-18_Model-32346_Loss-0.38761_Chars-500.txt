 ONLY TWILIGHT. FOR BOOKS TO SHINE



 to reliving in a bitch where the rain is shrieking into
to me kissed
 into the mirage, instead but cheek cast
         in clothes instead to be fled,
 theirs to the theater.
 pretending into the corner.
  
 poly airs in the way, i'll reminding year
 into pane growl to kneved
 in the bath towers, in a man stillness.
  
 coyote in this valley.

and the moon. loose eggs
 

a snow ferling absent
void may i walk, plows,
  warm is meanes.
 no one

 OF SORROW SAWTON CLOUD


 blinding the feeling weaves of two-breeze, for gold
 crossing me one, and with drops of house,
of ancient soar to his velvet game sears up and then 
i'm a shokes reclaim in his tongue, and it not.
  
 the rain cargo sin said, in her rolled by.
i want to be back in a phase-tipi flakes me
 like the living we looked with them
 my father helping the mouths when
 bless of actual friendly connection
what do you hurled in their fate, laughter
 laying his whisper, o fell them 
and say memory of dress. 

a dozen, their secrecking here

 IT IS A BOOTLE WITH POTRELOOP   


has far explorers, and something bathed, corn 
      to see hovers, spurted to americah, cars make i get   
i am a going holes women comes a girl's legs   
         thrust want as flicker that leads jund was on   

hung there is your being perfume, from on easy hepat,   
thing light summoner of that once, palm first out   
oil there out your elbows 
his moth, and the tensed slope? she to see    into pound,   
walk in the screen
like a dance in new my car    that proppeds   
falling to an old carrying the voice 
he me

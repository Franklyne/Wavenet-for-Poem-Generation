 TO DEEP MY HEART BEFORE DUST,


our elbows in a puddle one recompensy, 
for eekine was rushing out of the word
wedding the contration in the snow and edwing,
the pinnant's in aroma of decembering life.


standing my births from pan atoms i were no one else 
in tohol, such a boy can gui back to it.
who leave justioning is the truth of the wetting 
and gum of the gold couped by the sun. tone there's nothingness
of thing surdocotic call-saw like your medic endow.


among the sturdy, transom jusset-so

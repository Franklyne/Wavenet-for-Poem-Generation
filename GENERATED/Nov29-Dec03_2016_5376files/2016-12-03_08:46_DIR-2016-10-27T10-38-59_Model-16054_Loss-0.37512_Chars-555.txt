 EXPLORING DEFIRES FUN.


 then t
on warship rolling, and for twelve o'er
i grew into rosick but never creerlessing into monarchs,
stalk could warm, straight   
 shall burnt and blowing wooded dead,
supless certain in a wall of ten,
 to look in a bowl turn the power,
palms of furlone arm-stopped, in the last,
you made me, but the whiter can sit lines,
without name, tempt lead out of them weep,
my speech of silently laid to save threw 
on squinted to know the cock corners
  
in the bees i got his branches, my triving 
but one legible & thought one else

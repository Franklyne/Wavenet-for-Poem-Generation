    WHO WERE THAT WOULD HAVE TROUBLE OUT


the splintered now.


i really baroquain,
  
                                                

to mind.
 where there i'm sheep sharpes paraches. 
move black till i am old lime
 in the shore great mail at the jewel. crawling
     to beckons.
  
 as figures & beautiful the chamber
 better a taguolitan,
elephants, like young me,
the nights miracles weave
               a family negroes center classroom
 the far hunger. you even boy, as thoughts,
the bull revered him each beis do nos   
 instead of cheeks a sheets

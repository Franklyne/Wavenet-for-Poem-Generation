 A FICKLING NIGHT 


a lover sherves beyond to living a poisonous future   
...

   you know what skills again, when the counter lovers snowing string i step, 
and leaves, the second lease prodigious ease thy immortal point.


for where than the low stops up the rose and lean, 
    for were motto shalt behold the towns are the trees 
      but thyself which we therefore stock
                        thy salad watt, but you do woe, 
          my nailed keep for, and their too make him 

can bereave made me that we durst twixt not leer. 
the next timidce

 A HORDE FOR CLOCK


the devil wasps of chaos, even
             and the cobwebbyu nuns.
  
the fleshy place--a cave of frosted potlet,
   in a fencess behind up then
the thread blake stem roots, snuggle my roofs'. 

another pain   city's this .
  
 the brave that's kill
 thoughts, our . the portrait of min-
 jead feigns limp, they were in life--
 he calls it up that sometimes don't wash,
 we too survive historical has made
 with choice smoke with a strange wearing.
 he ploased a repetitive repetition hammers aura, 
 the floated household prepared. . .

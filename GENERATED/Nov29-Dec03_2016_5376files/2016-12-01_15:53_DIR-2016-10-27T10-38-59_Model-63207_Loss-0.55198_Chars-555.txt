 INTO THE LIGHT, 


street susieve like some strap rhythmnite there are rise 
to a penny happy cheelly want, sit, or pstove enfolding 
ligger, approaching street in spotted crowned intake 
light thames' come to redefine way 
the window suspended, wrong 
came to a cup? 
who said, i turned for more 
thinking that is us, but thou canst the called,
bide it hath its sweeter
cutting in the first day 
and will pain, the dogs rushes
old creedness, 
come like the brush of their hands. 

and the blood cumme, they told her side, 
brilliant lard it a raggedy cliff

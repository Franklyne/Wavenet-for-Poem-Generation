 THE DREAMY ULYSSAS PLACES 




    as if at heavy-coloured gillyflood, 
                    then within the shadows secret, even 
anyway, but not to stand look and hedge. 

                           and rider's hook 
         prevail 

    but thy love, though i come frost. 
                                                             

                   who were in the maid 
                                       the green where 
that all bell by beauty from thee 
   shall not to wish,  come to each other.

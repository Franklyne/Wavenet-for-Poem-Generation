 AS IF


  
 the thunder and magic
                                           xxv.
  
 babylonian to sweep
 december

its dreams a like bald poetry
                            when
                                   down
 
 is holy the past foot more
is brown your
trademi when he becoming never fall
          the trailers branch,

which devy corn,
 making down to be rich as.
  
       promised, the horizon
and we stop inaccessibly
 in our new addictive
 he used me out like the brain
       spice

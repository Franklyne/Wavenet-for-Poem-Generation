 SEKE THY DREAD 


who plunder follow? 
      what is sick, ukum rock and flow god 
of jazz, sudden in their coming, 
       
      or in among not last 
and a stay, a youth of my mind. 
and not start of rage, life kept to me 
         or a use of troye-bush. 

though i drown dat so long and chase, 
         until the golden heads 
i sing the molecules together a hall, 
         of a deep, 
       to eire re-or, i love 
                real tanged with pain, 
         i dreamt is not dry. 

thee you in passes shines them 
            i live wad wagged

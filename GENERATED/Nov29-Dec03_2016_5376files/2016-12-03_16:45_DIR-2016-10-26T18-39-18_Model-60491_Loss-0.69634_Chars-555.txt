 ALL DAY GRANTING 


for i am a sigh as rifference   
as she could not cherry 
that children--the danced line, 

so they have been love, music   
acquel of ambalachine of the rooftree caverns 
until the poem 
buoy be the air. 
i can see my palm to hell, naples, banners,   
under feels and one-eyed alive 

up on rome possible pollen as friend   
indeed each other there at that first 
that cannot still picket,  so many. 

o milnifn does imaginess prancing about namecap, 
and art in the garden,
        nothing expression. and dued, in a mirror 
hills dogs

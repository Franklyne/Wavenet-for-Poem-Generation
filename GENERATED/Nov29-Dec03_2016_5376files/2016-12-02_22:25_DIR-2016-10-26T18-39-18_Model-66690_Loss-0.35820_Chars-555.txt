 THE RIVER--OWN GHOST.


 it is eased bench in its plight
 with the dead porquitating a scar,
 and through my telling like the odyssional mon's
 or so going to lucia, breathe and
 listens of course
 his eyes around around me
 films over the smoke,
 the lightning black consultimately
                                   the parking lips.
    
  
                                           cry out. the home
 any geese
                            to the dust.
                                                   


  

i presses from the wind to work

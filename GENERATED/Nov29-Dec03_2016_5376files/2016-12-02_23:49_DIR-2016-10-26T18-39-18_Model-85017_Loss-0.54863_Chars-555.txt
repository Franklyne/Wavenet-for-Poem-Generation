 HIS FACE SPRING


 the bug and scrolls those days i am
 yet for who had the atriffness
 of passers caught turns as they're girls on each other.
 once lightning to be all profundy, 
mine archivorousness--white men who catch
this isn't jump. he cared me suicide rhymes
i will first, making regives. smoothie 
true, i won't want fill you givising.

i was tears my absolute lipsticken.
every midnight a word, what must to face summer beer. 
legs over a scar out, said consider
i.i.a.  .
  
                     still in light,

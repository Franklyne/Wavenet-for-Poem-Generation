 BENEATH THE EARTH CITY HARD


of the rabbit's tahky
that bits the involuntary he roves 
and the struggle they hopped me will 
much our trousers, the piles of mosquitoes 
leus for whips that the sky,    i see claws the cry 
laugh to be one layers of ex-handed it divine.   
their words like a saints and broiling now 
about architecture on the wind truth a flight 
       or the spring masquery,
      in the young made a ride 

the little in the headache as not an ancient snow, 
lifts vangos the sharp behind our life

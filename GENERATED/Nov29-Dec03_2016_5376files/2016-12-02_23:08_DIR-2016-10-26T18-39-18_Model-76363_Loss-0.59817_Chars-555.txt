 MEANINGFUL HATS WATCHING SIDEWALKS


 he had my hills, grace,
                       and i knew word for pearls
 squirrels, pages years of it.
  
 i read the streets.
he knew he'll never given.
--sandals of tides closes rich
 and the legical rough and mud, my pleiads
 of other ron-he can thistle, for the world bed.


i am tutors or powder, 
the somare sidewalk terrace,
  
 and after the outside.

axe you forget the cells,
 to achede, neatly hands,
laughing so faint . nymphs of skin-
insincere poets
free-flesh of action
 come into the world,
bellies in

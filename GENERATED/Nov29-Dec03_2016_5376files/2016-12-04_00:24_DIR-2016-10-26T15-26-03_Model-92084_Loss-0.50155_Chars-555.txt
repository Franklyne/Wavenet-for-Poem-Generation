 ON THE LANDSCAPE OF BREATH


where were began to pick her in the carp, their butts    
sheets, you bitter--even before between 
by declared feet  each one
far in as i awoke a moment
summers this youth, open back
to the black-harlem powers, 
then can frighten mirrors.

one shoulder bows i drive
as histories, this small bone.

insanella holy my new places,
like stories
near
glass-needled, had not remember uncareed

my day companionable itmention that sweet tapestry house
in front of the arctic running of a poison of genius
don't tell her.

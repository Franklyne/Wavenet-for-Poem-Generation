 BOY'S VOICE AND TEN


dim only unleashed.


she laughs, she says
bearen the cup

in the parlorch in the balance

with its scale angles lit
matches them all judge
for commiss
sprinkled on their feet, spot

at a line there--the clock is empty,
crushed up and universe
sciologue the severita myself soul
in the memory
of adult i murderous locked
monster one of the day
on a bridge, pageoled off
olives, no woman in bed
like a blue hord anymore,
the tulip trunk, in her breast

you want to talk of my hair

       OF THE OPEN WINGS LIKE THAN THE WATER.




i looked girl merges at pavement.
 it was stopped tights.
before shoulder thoughts shall
cling the chrism petal 

tap wer scrimshaw
and a music 
of tribe mushrooms of every 
took every wad.

on the table
i notice before or studio 
running on a thing

upset speak to me in the sofa great grimacity
into the ghosts around the seashore
in a pin. fishes
reflected. nothing some around me
shoots at the fire of habor of what 
the world is sang of the current

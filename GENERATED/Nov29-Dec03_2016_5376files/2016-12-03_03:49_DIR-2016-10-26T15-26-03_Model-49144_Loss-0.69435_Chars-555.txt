 OR THAT SUMMER


just-hind, god was family but never cherry and halfway
the men that foamed a loverclap
fins behind in form, some guests on a fence
mistoard for her own linen bob- pook head, 

a crowd of gold puppies even 
of mea lunch, & geometry and clear was names
each one smoke
which the winter wives 
newly go through still-stands its rick-as-arks

& toil rich again
our trees, of grass island weather,
its large deprived an encircling
with a shaman in the universe
and din the prizeval silk
of her neck,
instead, i bore her ears reach.

traveling, hi

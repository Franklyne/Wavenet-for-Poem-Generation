 COMES FROM


 all are the cab field.
 on the craftiatory,
 the wind red resnace and
 that come to
 yellow-out, the cart holy season.

as if sins glitter of paid sea of piece
 believe the floors pitch and look behind   strout
of gambing in a piazzas are cut free
 when a boiled a bench this insurance is a left to death
  
 calling this cloth
 something that hatred in my touch can began humprised 
not torns to the holy of fires
 wells of what he can insire ominous
 us the book i was stations.
 she holy holy 
 to be wednesd in a bright perceived.

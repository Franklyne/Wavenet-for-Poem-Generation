      I WOULD YOU


 i wish i have the time wound us.
joer at dawn cry.
  
 beck a bird-off-lane,
 all alone
  
 on   nover, the suffering.
 hard as it to grasp destined skin centerbrave.
just shoping forest pot are america?
 for squiggling on my careet is many
  
 after my heart tossed a metal benti,
 from written fiber, and askedness
mate, half-who music. a tabled bits of course. 
 and passes to the flushing wind
 beyond smile in the falconry.
  
 benches but his mind, i love radwood face
until the new and young with the one.
 with no hunter motorcyc

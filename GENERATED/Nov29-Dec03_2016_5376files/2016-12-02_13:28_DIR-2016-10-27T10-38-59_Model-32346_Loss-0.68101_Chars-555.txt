 OPENS TO RUN. QUIEM WAVES


 seviet click on the cold jonguage at my hands to imaginary can till using the high and
 the choice dipping rocks, and legs in the cycle.
 in a wood turn the very pants of people misshaped arose,
 her frame of the creation cruises one floor, to trail or ever hate
we have the way
 death. i am alone helixires is enough tongue for even
  
  
 that when you could get in. leave
 grows of lovingly runs gone peace sound
 in bed me
 a stillness, i slow round, to bless me? 

           yet the leaves of departed
  
 the poem in thin

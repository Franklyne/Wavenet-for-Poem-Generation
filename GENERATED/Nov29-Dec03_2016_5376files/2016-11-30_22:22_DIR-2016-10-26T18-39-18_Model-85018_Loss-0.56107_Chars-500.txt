 OF IMPOSSIBLE-SURVEY--


 i feel along, endlessly, void and belt

the energy boom, i was critically, 
the blue can't all chuck our place.
 goat before you're no rhyme
 we once saying the found door sheathe              i
prenel house.  my deary we cannot, flourescent 
before dancing throughly flocks in the hospital
rooted our other ndongdom. i howl,
& the solemn hatred drawn by the belt flows that-john
pig dolphin must stalk if he'll raised . . .
as used to, i'll carry and paid purpose
 in yours.

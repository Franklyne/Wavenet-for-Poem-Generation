 TO LAVE A MOON


this wonderful foam a trail jingle and the boats 
bang and reply. dream?

that if i couldn't death--
the mayflower from sacks grey
buyer ay remained sending
to unsucked plodding untroubled
by a sow sway. seventy discovered crooked clings
of caravaggio hand organ diming knee. 
a cafronted gulfwed-with juice
from safe until the listening stops rammed,


belief and terrible, then,
styling my little space.
our heads, formula
begins. and dumb someandy
a girl and seeds it threat hip plan of stars.
the years of falling bouf dogs.

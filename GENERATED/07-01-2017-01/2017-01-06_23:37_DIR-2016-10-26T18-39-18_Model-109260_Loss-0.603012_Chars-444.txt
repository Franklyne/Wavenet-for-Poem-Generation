                                           might shows in a miniatures,
what is the poem their bell of dirt 
      esemies gone
boldlike, mortal evening       describe begs asleep.

             a darker i am,
       toward a slaves of the stitches 
          the belly calm.

simon as chime driven in paris
it drains, until the earth 
       when i trust

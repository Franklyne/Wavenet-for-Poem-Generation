the hubris small prosy
stamping stirs

which disciples
hesitations with darts
to necromancies of others
sind, thine

 

i sit here thithers in


it looks like winds cure in a word

and adieu this morning's dizzy peath
on limns
that the ravage
you are strand softly tongue

in the soul of my narrow floorboards,
nobly has been the river. 

iria


that battlefield of jesse 
lasc comes to be.


nothing your hooie
light
with tea

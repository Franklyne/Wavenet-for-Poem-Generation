 this tree is so good mile well lost
 as i wrapped up with aager
                     ye bootism echoe.
the sun can do with anything 
                and wash in termittent dialectic waves
brushed me and ywa in hector's stem rivers
              citic is like.

dropped between my hand swallows flymouth ancient
                                                                                              as taste

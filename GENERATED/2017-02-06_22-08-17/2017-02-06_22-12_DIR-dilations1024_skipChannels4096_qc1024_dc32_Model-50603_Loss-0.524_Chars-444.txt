 GOOD AND SEEPING THE SOUND OF PARALLEL BUT


  
 seep tiles of seven, the valley kerees.
 he paradise is gods are as passable,
 to a sometime. in the two-toastess,
 and there are the hall windows are people,
 womb among the yellow to the stench.
  
 a lenore that shadowed, memorial, and white
 on the dark night mie building the old song
 smooth and spain. as last lay west.
 and by the sound
 send us in cosmic the ocean feed 
 bring the edges

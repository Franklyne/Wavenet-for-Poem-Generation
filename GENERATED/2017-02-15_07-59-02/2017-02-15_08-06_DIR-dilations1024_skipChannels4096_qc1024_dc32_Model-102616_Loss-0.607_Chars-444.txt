 WAKING ENGINES DEAD,


and angel, no way of the sand extinguished square 
how intimate of breath and papers
twelve years
a waterbey's cranes sounds and lines
barking and unhappiness. milk knowing

truly djelling its contagiously haunt,
she had a thing
so he did not mind your thinking.
many words  her cut the prolific years--

the gazer's enduring tennessee.



in six monday. 
is that's me. in the streets between.

he would have been, but now

 DERANGED THRIVES STAMENS, SEARED WITH OPEN THERE



moons on
the country's name in the boat on the sandpipe
as orchard the sad and us to be wrenching forefingers'
i'd done that made the number
lollid freedom that something 
poetry of punished painter fancy

through the dosh, on the floor that fled, 
or replies patterns' reat. i can remember
and we stand on to the tin books and then
sunk a trapper need breast into rest
on lemon grasp decrees-l

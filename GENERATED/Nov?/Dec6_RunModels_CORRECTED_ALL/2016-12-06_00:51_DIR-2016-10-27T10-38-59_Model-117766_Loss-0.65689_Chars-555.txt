a cruel pressure above the wall
in the whole corpse
breaks, but on the painted paint,
down to die and hesitates land

mooop great joke you 
in the empty must embrace.
the three of my daddy
the moon and from us,
we mime to heal jets.

nobody i never hear.

age, is one or raining for the last few
will vulging in a major for his lectured 
by the transparento,
please             five days
wincas no words me niecerner,
         sing on the turning
    address. hu love you,
    to move any breaks
where.   still lengthens broken to the narrow too

a negle

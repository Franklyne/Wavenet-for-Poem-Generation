 PRINCE'S LEAP


and we flatten years, the new gryowo,
 fixin'd sometimes of kids--whose life. i spin this
chimneys and a golden sister, between triple round

the pure groves of the world of never whine.
i dreaming salt from his bony. 
all we find the world we mention meet,
we tell him to play through my footstep
his night one, beyond sleeves
through each in a union building lacking crayon,
. . . . and as a good for the person
 course you, for your voice has caught
and the death of fig train cared nighthawk,
 with sapphire--estiza, the mine-wrist.

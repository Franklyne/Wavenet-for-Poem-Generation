 IN A POLE-TREE BEING ON,


 sits us to be address.




dusk
 to slip to shovel tree
 
fence, camseted in the poem i
 cool saying

oppies, holy tender
  
 can't
 
so get turned to shore
like the balconies
 like a bench,
 you, ancient dawn
mister, she cups
 this doings
 lucia's die
  
 my crust
 
  
  
  
  
 .   
 so the lones

of this part of   
  
 because
comfort
 or stairs, safer beetle
  
  
 the solitude light loose.
 its ottsive
 from

 climbed in love

is the trade

 time
  
 to a mural
 
  
 to the radio

once-old
       soulsbox
 --
proclaim

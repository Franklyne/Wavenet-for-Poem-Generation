 DISPLAY WAS THIN BALLAD SNOW OF THE TIME OF BARREL


 like a westward creep. i accumulated
 by the moon but though he fight be. many tenderness 
 sprang from the dripping soap.
  
 thank god-luck of everywhere cursive
                                       fusions and proverb,               through the town my chest
 if any old houses. roll'd fierce the girl's seventy-five wound
 until days
 one like the glimpsed
 think tourists, shinous is to frost-unknown
 sleep and a thing, mouth
          of the tackle through

anger apples if set of gold

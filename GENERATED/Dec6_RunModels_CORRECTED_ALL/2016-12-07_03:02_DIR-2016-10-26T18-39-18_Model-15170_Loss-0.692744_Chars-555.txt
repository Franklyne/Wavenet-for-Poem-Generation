    there is the wallows unclean,
       migratic,
 long like wood to know poem
  
and this wrinkled details turning,
 our body their orange me,
 and roard, the hopes   
                                    we track.
 indifferent
  
 piper meet
                                       waring into an e'erth 

to learning restle
                                                                             inspiration, gabreles 
        xxxi.
  
  
 go anemotion?
 the moon squeezing
 each, with hanks
 self-uncanny yeans
 that imult like stringing

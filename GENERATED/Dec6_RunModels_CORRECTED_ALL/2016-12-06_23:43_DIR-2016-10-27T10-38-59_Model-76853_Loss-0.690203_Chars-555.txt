 WORD LIKE THE CHILDREN


       unt turns on the back

officer against their stomach
sos and keyp but only
here of them 

while might turns exploding 
as
lipstort did not for you
    are with

but their homes of prore-quack 

--and wheels of other. you don't believe

no ankle wall into their eyes

chariot seed, away
blubbered over your bed angel?
never left this world
exchanged 
hold me that one takes

now why blue walled
in a whisper of your face

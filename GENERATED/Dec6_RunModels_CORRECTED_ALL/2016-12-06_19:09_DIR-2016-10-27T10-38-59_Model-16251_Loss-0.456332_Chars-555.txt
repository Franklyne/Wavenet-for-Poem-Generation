 HOW


 behind railings the hat
 objecting done

                 echoi of them cases.
  
 building is 
              not death.
  
 her way our simple
as the seas blood i see
when he keep the radder ripped, 
i shoulder, senser-out and moccasing muvs.


the sun, a trains from yocmose
 my flabby is all day in the blackbeat
 my tells they had jump hair,
mind walls constitutions.



the towns fans in white man joiny lines
waiting the gorn or prairies
that cleminds of occasions

could i feel men skies
each us. his brain creasing along preiche

 IN JANE ABOUT SAINT WORD IN YOUR JACKET. 


and cadence you thoughts, and now
paying back at the burial amputation take with
 and so we snuggle in the yard? 

a pressing i roll on the wing high school noney,
the rest of the last gone all that quail on
spoon and in on, one of youth my lap i would grow 
our house in the autobiographudent half rooms imp, 
in sunny eyes working on paper clyroya partition.
and you go. i'm rather transter, laymates dass
or broken by the lagoon why it was not yet.

only night unpick the churny scream inside a lyric
him safem

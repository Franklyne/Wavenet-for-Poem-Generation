 DAY LIKE'S FEVER


herlament in the rasp of a resudiate motto,
what's be 
anti-something . what did you or rounded
as a clock on this raced in thy write.

she sure the covered music, where

and sike you can stand arms to feel

a wind, your conversation, its need into it,
old romps of longing,
a single greed clbpt another
in scomputed a grans
 
i'm pictoured into other
she watched up
a vacuum
 or a sound so at shosha

explained by hunger at least smart
or that lawcic than ouncement 
from whatever's different god, under the whole hoff-open down thousand

 MOONDAY HEARTS LIKE LIGHT AGAINST


up signs
heavy so i sit up at the dawn question will hide among the soccer ankle,
our remembers over their heaving news? you taught her, when i go
shimmer of the blinking of the will never have had to lie down
 way to keep but unable tales overhear store
                                                  heavy, crushed

a bull promises, i learned to and you feel
& where loud here
                                  he's step. winters did not like merry
that life inside that's missing and digging
      a slight of rock.

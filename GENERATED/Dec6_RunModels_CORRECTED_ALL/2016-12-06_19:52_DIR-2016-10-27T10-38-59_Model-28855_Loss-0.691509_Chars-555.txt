vision- the red-house    a minute 
           i know it sing so glass we san on the stay.


           from king-hung thunder 

yf master beyond the halls, the grave 
      and a faint stones rollel, 
the son, grew and beam with a grin 
because i awry alone as hung 
   my heart,
to dust, mute 
hasna i still.
       there bible voud.

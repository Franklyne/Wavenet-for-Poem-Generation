 TENSE TIMES, TRAPS SHINY OUT.


 falls up swims in the last night and walking
the most until, not out, you're not would says
i am my mouth to change, it spent
did, say typides a child, the middle
in the trunk one knows tell
 our rustle no small prates of nostalgia

i trave dog to send in the spilled delique sitting, 
and of anx shine for slaughter's feet

 



harkening happened you naked, nor not to
out intimate the bell. the arms must.


delicating yawn inwardness, the dogs blur
it become willingly undone,
 rustful and red step and falls upon again,

   MY EYES


 wanna keyholes it's oracle--
and despair 
 no clouds.

disappeared, the lases sun seed.
  
 the windows of the eye--that's late
 was never inserrupted.

 as blue.
the drugged eyes of elevators
 she was on his own.

with easier's hush in chews too late 
through canshot, he step through

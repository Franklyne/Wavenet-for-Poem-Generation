 THE ANGELS, WALLS


 and when you for us who empty street in at the porch room
 filling file children in a dream of a heavy keeper.  
crooked at levastation, bombs.
 mister when sat asunder or knocking in the balms.
  
  
 i.



  
 brew here were engines,
  
 but in the bay
tipped him to the junglew brow,
 the victoria that is?
when you are positive
 in hallways, cane so?
 masterminder a clean hallelus
 herner you? they are,
 mountains, at midnight to drown all the stones.
 not again the blackness,
  
 tramping flukes of phasels
 over the gloomyshop

 the little master in  
     

all in a sympath

i sore hides
the sailor i hurt than tridawath the gaucherous knife. 
              its pulse off . fantastic stubble the lanor surfboard

--is thick i made love park the width
              nor the past
  
 i swallowed to the lake, a drop on rue to your 
and weeping the submarine.
                                           but
because is real that witt heard from your verse

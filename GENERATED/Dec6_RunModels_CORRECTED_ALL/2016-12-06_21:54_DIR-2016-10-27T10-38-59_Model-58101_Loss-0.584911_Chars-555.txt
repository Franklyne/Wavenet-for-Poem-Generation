 YOUR CAP OF FEATHERS,


 every ships with pages in, weiving 
 and carry lock.
shaped like mucker, drinking
  
 a jerked as we go on, are
 and lit ever knocked up
 it had been in need.
  
 says you crawl
 you looking off an ornament
 to  temple the angle sucked dust,
  
 that sometimes a palm,
 its time i make me
 a kind of all woman
  
 devision
 the skin
 breathing my breathing
 to be wrong.
  
 their wings told hand oil
  
 and the sliver appeared,
 sleeve
 bengala. after red and haunted
 onto lifetimes to country changes
 informity, livet une weigh

 GREEN LIKE CANDY

 there it degrees to be for an eltars
                             the old
  at all another
 an each paradox, onto go in the test
  
  
                                you still man.
a plenter, food, we've gone.

 and you want my climbedeth lawn
            that secret, torches
 the swinging child eternity of log

             i read solemn. her own
    in a mail white

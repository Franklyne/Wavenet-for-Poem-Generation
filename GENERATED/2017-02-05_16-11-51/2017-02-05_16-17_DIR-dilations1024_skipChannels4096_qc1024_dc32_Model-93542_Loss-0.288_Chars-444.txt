 DIM A BAR,


 you must pass this evidence
 krown & gleam too
 the hurried one,
 do thousand year's 
 beating in drift
 farmes away, dear
 backda, fearful to you
 on the world pen ringing
 they say i knew to
 leaks a tattered white 
to them watcher safe hard,
  
 laples, skin
  
 the men at the shout,
 the men dream and yet to say
 the positional fault.
  
 the slake 
 in the syllables afterbeitoire
 let out the shoire to marvel.
  
 the brief

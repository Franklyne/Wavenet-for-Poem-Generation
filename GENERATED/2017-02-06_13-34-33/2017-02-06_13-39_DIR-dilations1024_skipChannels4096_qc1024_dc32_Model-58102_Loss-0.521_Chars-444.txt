 WITH THE OPEN FACE


 that now we wake to the loom pockets
 and into jowl worm
 good the light limbs
 broke chimes holy
 ghostly, feeding a white tongue
 seems to pledge sires.



blind in
 down your heart if
 this is allowing the faint.

 rogene in as interests,
 she flattened,
 what was sick for old woman good--
  
 where a dead man with iclaim
 you was burned against my mom
 i notices the silk, roads closes.

 EARLY WE


oncenditures riber over
and the men slides huddled water blankets
whose majesty
bury the wound

their laughter
day i am not
the rats are
the farewell that i kiss
the cuts under
bred ether 

the pullings
the mind is just
that disappear
nest itself
stars growing like autumns

ever believes on a rich
could be empty
centary portraitate,

from the words, 
we pick some light
the strange from the st. absolved

them, thoughts justice,
eith

 CLAIDEFES GRIPS 


before the fountains
of late afternoons

it times i sat thee the shrapnel
and is, the hester,
free 
something moves
in the vision

social stop and up on kggow
that i wasn't do for
a place that lucifer,

one day to me for children,
by monkey's garden.

do you have ima one

lenning like train, a square



mistlets from the mythical stars
a crush of our bastard,
as the boats at the great
and hedges vinyl 

with these hands

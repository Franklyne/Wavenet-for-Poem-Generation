        HAT FROM THE RADISH   


countless laws ago and our children   
cams your hand impulse this 
you ask souths rejection 
across the book and 

you know 
                                       
a just spark or cemeteries of burning   
                               snow dark clad was in 
                                    on my our rschen 
i enter yours. 
i want you at dawn 

                               mountains slain for hell. 
                                  not afraid searchlights   
                                                   and sociab harlotte moved at charms of clouds si colin   
                                                                         ne  now courage at the edgy   
condescend their heads are not saint   
                                                                              are less in that bang eyes

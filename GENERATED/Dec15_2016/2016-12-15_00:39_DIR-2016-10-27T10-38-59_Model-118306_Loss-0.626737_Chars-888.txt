   THEY CURRYING OUR PADDLE


 also on whatever hating her
lord its for a moment thinking of eve
  
 in the curtains, i blurted without
 in a lone starts that sutter.
 all along
 hallucination solace them, until
 canyons
 oaths you been dream, it all saver
 after i disappears, and inevitable seem
  
 i've found the backs
  
 it is their agility
 like a 
open wind me around with stone is entires
           
 as also phew
  
 and the cotton coqueting us
    as shadows on the spool
  
 the bones of day 
 what can belief in la leafens
 limping off over,
    of hunger?            

today their inching 
          would slip i called myself
  
 with that gives of oxen y'ar,
what crooked as the paper          a girl world
              awake and tackled
  
 then season is an unlit that rings
               were reeds like
                                       a place

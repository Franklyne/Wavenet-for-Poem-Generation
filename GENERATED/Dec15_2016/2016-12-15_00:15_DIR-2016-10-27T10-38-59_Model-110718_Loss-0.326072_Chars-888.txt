 THERE WAS A DANCE


                                              reflexions
 next to hold them
                                                     hand.
  
 ah gathering then the mountains gifts
                       lion into the nest.
                     a black mastodon of snow
                                are as we do.
                 to love to name the yard
                attracts to bathe fills
  
                                                       --and fled,
                                          sweat and stone
                   to iod capsule's by
                                            in the lap and cavern
                 you all restlessness
                                to watch the sky was met.
                                                                      years
      a new york city and shadows and spaces

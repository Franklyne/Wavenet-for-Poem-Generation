        OF THE OTHERS LIFE,


said beautiful, and stone woman
 strewn chanting a barnyard, holy
 on paid soak as his goatish carveh. she shouts, it wokeness as parolina.
the foreshor--
                                                
                                                                        put out,
                       sighs of course.
why whale things we shut to that everyone,

                                      a beach the
                                       .                                                        will 
        breath.
  
 the bod to taste phens                        the visor with pain 
       plucked my own, all this, 
                 deliver
                        
                              each wonder him pause.
                                                                                                                 ..

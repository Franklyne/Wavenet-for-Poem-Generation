 AND TUNES, SO FAIR.




                                      that clout do? 



 

they juttle triumphantly the fingers

straight speak out, smutty sad frail evide, kiss.

returning, for poles of men-out despair

for being writing everlasting the time 
that now i demure livelier than the files are the way

for the cloak around each con pink, grace eternal park,
       you have a dime thou lie on it 
   we ask we have known as a few to use 
he, waits from the apprentice we smile, 
so loud can common the nodding, i start in the ocean 
among denied and sky, or voice he can meet
mourn, on thy hair an ivory i have taught, 
when summer trucks, and regards unstrung

is what thou dispensed what love the evenings are strikes and 
the angels and wild, wanton me yours and 
forth of the wretch 
of sylvan i name hell, we must be, 
i want to kiss our garland, 

love in the sexless communist

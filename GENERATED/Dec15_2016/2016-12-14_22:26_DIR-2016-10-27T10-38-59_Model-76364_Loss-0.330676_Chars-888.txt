 SNTALLED SILK LIFE


of mile of mine in factles will start.
 the weight of teeth made my might wolf,
 his on snooves it befits before you and flanting
 the trees a staircase like a ring, my children,
  
 a stone two designing that masks 
then the boy corpse of ghost succor
 by the my own hand from the boats
 of innocent plans of demon sobries,
 and put most of the blessing in strafing 
or did i was the glass both. his body.
 as the things that i could on the yard
 there's a man's knife. he knows his soft-skin office
 of sayly was faithful floating air charters
 in your stilling it kiss.
  
 into mland like him to live them
 and now space thege, but near the siege
to glory as undone. i want mind to me
 in the grave? a hay try them
 that celebration the forehead bill
 the vase of the small arm. one's shadow.

 then twinkle of my nation's good
 with of pounding cypressed ironal me

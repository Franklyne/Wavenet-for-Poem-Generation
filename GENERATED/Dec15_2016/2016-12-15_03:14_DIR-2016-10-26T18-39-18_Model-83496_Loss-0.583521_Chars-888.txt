twine when we don't even waiting
                                     would jummed
with the seas of the some moon,
            chance. the edges squirrel their eyes.
for japann and over these resh,
exposing in branches
thinking, no return, they return 
by these songs invited by anothandy, experience,

surmounting them and tetuitable 
they are a jew of
leaving, the meloved straining and sees
traces sinks in her selves and sally
mothplaces, the ground gold
simply saith light
walter b, chewing at the conchers what shasta
and the skull down, elsewhere--
as one over wrighted hands 
clouds or stopped to you speak
shine death inhabit ground
awful and spent, he 
light use rooms, two guns, feeder each contemporary
punished my own forest pales, for a commotion
.  
cramp your bound herself smell freely
from screens kill the evening will he saw,
under miracle
scribbled, the green woo

    BARE FEELING OUTWETTERANCESIS IS ROCKED BELOW


touched a plane your case into us now sleeper,
and the teenagerse, and the silver to maim

a touch to the finest never turned off

a bend, until the road.
my hairs i man, knees chosen

tekmoot at the bones grimace of plunge.
she tries to lose the memory pleasure especially
or the temporary o'erstreams
and his teeth sick leg
grandflung down her to give the eternal bar,
let me getting to me hollows.
o, gussip in branches growth,
gloveled by my hearth,
sail, 
like nights clowing on our image,
a ragged hair dummy smoke from their cobe pacific
by growing white bouquet.
haggard through talk of beer with your butter braws.
it is indian and do not leaving a cleave mountains,
all me tameradiction
the madle
smashed the shoulder swole
is clowing
into an entire art can blinding empty
garden at their jive
twins, one street in his
ever durin

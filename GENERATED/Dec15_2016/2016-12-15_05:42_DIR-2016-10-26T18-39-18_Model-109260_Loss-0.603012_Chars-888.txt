         AREN'T NOW GLANCE-- 


before hefting aspirations town. away clock, 
the sneeze with envy over the long
too will crime and grey-morning at two 
big my hands 
of words in the back they drive you still brush the snow school,
timothy, sun's fingertips clothes
the hero away? i cannot prove the light
sneaks in some makes up a gull
as you remember-nettaille

the homeless but together with a tender gape
not even now your apple my
think it from the dark men who inside, it
would you alone all out and sundays
like spices twilight but

the finities-lined up poorly an universe, mossing
outwears whole souls

fat-tede aunt, i am harassed by then 
a piece of the stanzas goes
and love birth of deml in ice they make--
the most face was like some i suppose 

which one day week, that last american
and peeps won't really they knew, --
again in abundance--they shirks would still.


how long

 IN THE HARBOR, AND A DIAMOND-


 her word to let grow yet. party to pin.
                       hushed catch in lightning no any peoplent

than dogs and still, and win.
  
 when of she is my ben
 barre. i walk shapes all for could silent bits
  
                    at later is the seat.
 balds and 

the cup in the tides was webs
 and then the whole a breed,
                                             hunchase, it is summer
  
       floor, i have a pad-quite is weighted.
  
 on my windows in her god with hands
                                                                                        and heaviniger apart
                                                                                                                                                                        flotsan. kie in rocks to the primal hair
            husted to make an excitement feel shadows

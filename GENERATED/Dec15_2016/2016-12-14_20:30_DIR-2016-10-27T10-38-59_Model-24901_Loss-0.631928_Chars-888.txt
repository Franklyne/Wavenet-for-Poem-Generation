 IT WILL BE 


your lives retire, lools on the breeze of it.
 the plaque around a red
 in the terms drunking about a ballet
 romoved.

we was opened the love & things
 i get thoughts and clench words,
we were to invade the bases 
of pen feet letters that bless
ranging an uncanaries deadly,
that will be dying abraham and the bilgam. 

from arrow. the window treason us
 but combs like glad kerore
 camans to the bantry
and not that will do before.
 
instead of the sea,
tethered, in atlantic snight.

i looking up just the old
 box, hurt back
 can always night. 
two under, the angry.

though way beneath him.
  
  
 soon hath in the throne. 
 overheard
to wash a card out i have.
 

as dragged by him
on water, absurd artist

clifling it
  
                      .
 he enison
 and salt her
  
      and trredia decide.
pacing
                                       the new joe every candy,

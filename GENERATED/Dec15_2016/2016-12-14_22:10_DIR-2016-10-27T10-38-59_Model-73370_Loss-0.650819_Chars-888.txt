 THEY 


health not to be canst not too am, under door   
you pious her yearing measured with six we heard frost
the grand, pull'd wife, no matter heart.

some day we fixed courteous back.

twan, leaves heat one of thine in covert. 

perfumes' graciously warm breathed to pleasing of water 
so edisbeed on thy foul providence.   below,   
says looking to council. there's love unemployed. 
heels and fink, in ground, phantom bears run 
but these he be recruit until weather,

           their images he didn't run hand. 
                                   and day 
ruffling rum or mine, with that won't good. 
                lord on the slaughters roll. 

                       iy limbs tall, when clotters of the shade

       of this obituary, thy life threatening tomb? 

                           like unearthly coweries.

 EXTRA PRIZE IN THE OARS


 maces of measure i closed on the sky,
 sew
a nuclet us
 a page belts and rock-let
i hate architectured ever seen,
when we were before the bird-maula
that veil job and this
raked on a tupkeeper
that sulfur seas

precious brake,
ready, no island i do know,
yet there will for,
on the only man sparks of melt
a god has been too--

and isn't as of salt
the fire kinda shake of the lotus
and the old pelvis 
like basic into

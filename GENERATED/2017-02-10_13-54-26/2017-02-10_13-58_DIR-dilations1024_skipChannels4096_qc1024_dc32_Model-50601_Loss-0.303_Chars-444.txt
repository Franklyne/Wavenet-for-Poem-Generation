   AND WE?


  
 sex on my thoughts,
 a body dead sewdam the strop
 and ur with too much
 among the first blank 
 thought falls
 when on my hand on the hide
 of its tin slant verbals and oat.
  
 a hell of short restaurant
 seems to captain ill-
 see which the tearr of soyalt, a thoughts.
  
 the bramble in a tin-banded tomato shimmering
 swoon and strap on.

it's a shiver over the screen,
 and in us in apron,
littering sky. i know i lay
 oh,

 LOVE DEFILED



 he'll enter the poem for a coastal 
 sharpenies do of praise,
 the birds 
  
 says roam past every grass-firefly's fool
  
 let him sullena.
 


 our house lingerific acid.
  
   hackax, rest a country,
 who art the eagle 
 image
 a cool. 
 a touch




stillness nigger, flying flushed
 and tender too
center of the knee, in texi
  
 men and thinking 
study now to speak
 the 
 'ahn't been in front
in the margin, especially seed

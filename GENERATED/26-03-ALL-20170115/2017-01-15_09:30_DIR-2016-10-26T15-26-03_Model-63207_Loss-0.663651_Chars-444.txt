which made us i, choked as a shine 
      look hearts present memories, 
the gloving faceive for lean
wheat of their eyes are a cetty-april, 
   arms of shadow with the hospital's texts 
       no more--all afternoon with further, 
      during thee, his due and swords,
on a congregation of the mesa, 
      we'll gather 
in the drafts of untrails, house 
a candle in flux, boomlay, unhungered. 
monic makes slowly have endures, 
free glass

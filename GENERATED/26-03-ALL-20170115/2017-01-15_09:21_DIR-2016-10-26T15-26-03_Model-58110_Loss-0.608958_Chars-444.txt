 OFF THE SEA WITH THE EARTH.


  
 it's dig not choose, automatic held
 shoulders over the railing
 and swirling
 who lives me.
 i saw him in the world hasn't see,
 i do not this

 one
 he looked to the tower. sut,
 terminally
at times what
 spreads towards him pool,
 to marry. the deafer horizon dead
 these are not a fooler televisions.
  
 after all the tall me.
 that holy red secrets through.
 loyaly bomb of straws,
 myself morning apathy.

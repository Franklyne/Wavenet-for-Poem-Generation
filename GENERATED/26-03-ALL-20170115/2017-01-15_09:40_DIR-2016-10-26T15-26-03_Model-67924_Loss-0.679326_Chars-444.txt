 THE BELIEVER FOREVER.


a missing mirrors--my friend, as if her age
of his own protected.
      a--elming &
and orchids, the nurse keys, 
   he gives her hood, vitching them
what's left in those blows drunkenly, but pen,
   but not yet be others' green you can say,
 & was he. we also we also say', a sound.
sweet change of high walls of dark
reader but joshua contact,
 take my foe, more curator. yet i'd be.
no accounting,

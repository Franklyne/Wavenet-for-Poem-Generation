 SENT BY THE SPOT


until too, of eyes i look as angels,
 where is toward vertigious snow,
where overdue and unhinges too close.
it dawn him--a shade--
                                                                                                and then the flame, he
love is more in the middle being loud asus come there
         stay a stern, a death, if i could hear,
                   in the valley light, every partwh--
the beam at my arm

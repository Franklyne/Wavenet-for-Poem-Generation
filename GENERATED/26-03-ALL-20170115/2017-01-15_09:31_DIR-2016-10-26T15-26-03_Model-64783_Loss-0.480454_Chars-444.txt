   GLASS YOUR MIGHT CREATE 


    there i oft in with me? 

imagine man, airy the trees, 
tiny works a star 
and afternoon 
   cleared from the whole   
when i, the greedy pulled fans.
in the united floors, and truth   
throb, my head and nature reign. 

all day goods in speech, miss in few, 
sit, glories, or is all the powers, 

that so in each rather arrive this will not take, stubbs 
of doubtful shame.

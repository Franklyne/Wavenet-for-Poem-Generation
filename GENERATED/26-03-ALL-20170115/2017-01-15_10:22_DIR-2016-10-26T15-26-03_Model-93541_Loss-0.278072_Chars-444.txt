 DISGUISES FOR THEM. TELL ME


 a translation in hand, this long ne embers
 white i talk to lick up from the time or white must go 
 freshly dear on the scabby shot of survivor.
  
 perfect as a boy is many a prairie
 hence transcribing sharp at the key to lie, 
 of beads which down over their tongues
 in his shirts calls oil curves,
 above the improcreated eyes,
 thus long as the prairie hero form them 
 the banks of his hearts clayon half.

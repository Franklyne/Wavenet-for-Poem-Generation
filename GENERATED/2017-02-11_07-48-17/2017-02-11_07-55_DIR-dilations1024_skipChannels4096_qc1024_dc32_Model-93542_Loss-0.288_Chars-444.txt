           THE SEVEN HUNT OF STARLINGS ZUMBLE. IT IS MEC SOUND SOMEHOW.



call me the cross is songs for the glass, athletic fish overhead,
strung her head, so the buraable flight.
god mother's up in the wood, with my feet

and they once say crevassy be patient whisper of them
burning asylum will they were a giant me.
a boy youd are because we do not recognize they don't know 

a man whose generation.
a girl attached to his barking lair of it

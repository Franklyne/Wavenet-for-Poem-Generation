 THE TEA HUNDRED-POTS.


some soldiers down on high pines
in the morning. my mother staring atmosphere 
over the black dissolve abonaude it was

shone. that's how incessantly stem to


while ever tears for the pagants
paper bag flags
and sisters in colored back against you
wearing like a gigantic colors
erect. i do not ever love in which 

and in that dead posts on earthquake' ones
another days well hang.

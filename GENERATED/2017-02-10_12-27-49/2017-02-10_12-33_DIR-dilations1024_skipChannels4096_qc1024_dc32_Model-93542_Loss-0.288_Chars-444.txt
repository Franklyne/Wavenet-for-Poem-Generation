 NEPHEW,


 on the teeth of the shipyren breath.
 ah al nuda straight keeps the brookly tip 
 of rain last seeds and left
 and and all that does not turn its secret,
 give me not the rain sign, 
 or break and guts on patterns deaths 
 as my affair blind, he drew the strife's eyes
                in order and cuttle.
 and then calls twig on the women
                           the whole black letter to museums
 eye-of-a-pollution

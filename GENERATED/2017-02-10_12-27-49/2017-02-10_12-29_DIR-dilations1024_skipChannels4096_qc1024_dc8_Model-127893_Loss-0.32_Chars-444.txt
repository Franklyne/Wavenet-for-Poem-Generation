 PAGE HALT,



into the sisters waiting
gardens, goes before the world sees
 swat and salt
who cough
 o taste,
 leaves
the gutter
near rolling

a straves and cut
 and aftermath the air

fughing there's a code
 in our step
towers in grease hard

polyested the saint,
sings
 he hooks,
on their faces
champing rivers


eased the vow's
keep
of how lived them for -
of rubies
 and left.

the mind nest



however comes
york,
 or the briar dumped-up

me

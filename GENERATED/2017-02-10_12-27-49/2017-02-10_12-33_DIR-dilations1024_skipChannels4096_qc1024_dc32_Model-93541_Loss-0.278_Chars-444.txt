     RENT MY POETRY IN A SOUL UNKNOWN CATS OR OR OF FATE.


                dis after the wounded plot pretenses
                                          and 'neath me ded to the feet.
                                                          yet against arcade
  
 she never second leaves the same faces in his upturned sack.
  
                                                              .

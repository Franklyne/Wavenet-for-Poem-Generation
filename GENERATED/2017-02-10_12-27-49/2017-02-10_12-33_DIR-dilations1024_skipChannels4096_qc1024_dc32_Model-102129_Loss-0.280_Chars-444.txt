 ALL I KNEW YOU


 trying to touch the other in town.
an his own eye milk as the cry undersides and me
as a wall on the bathroom laid and one was old ship
 a saying's cactus and plato you embrace.


there yet say

what he yanked
as the policeboard, together
in the sail, the other will have matted, 
 all over the house
you aren't thought on a man-and i

blues.
to my tempo never  seemed.

would be ourselves turning.

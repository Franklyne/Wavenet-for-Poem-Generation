 IN THE BLUE-EYED SULLEN


 glow no one in the adore heartbeat
  
 to at my eye mocks at tent
  
 solemn for later and unclean, 
 saying. looking ooner's
 a republic band of paper.
 the gangway sound a train
 rival in nothing
  
 carriers and with springs look
 as the sun string underlined sacks
 of my grandfather, the glittering
 around to further faiths
  
 extert the certain bludes of skin
 suicidal left. tori,
 rain
in various bench.

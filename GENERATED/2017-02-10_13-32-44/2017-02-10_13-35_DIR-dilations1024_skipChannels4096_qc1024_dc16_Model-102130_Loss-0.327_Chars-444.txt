 NESTLED SILVER NIGHT


 for the notes

neither just scrap of ink stupefied
 of tea last epial, or so much of me--
i hold at the crocuses of time to the universe.
and upward into the lure inside, bundles
to the governing of the arrival day
the hem made man in the joys of line,
when to the one who knew his smiles.


intelligence of other hip. salt
in tendon and zaising small numbers.
everything stir limb, walking into a tear
in what wasn't read

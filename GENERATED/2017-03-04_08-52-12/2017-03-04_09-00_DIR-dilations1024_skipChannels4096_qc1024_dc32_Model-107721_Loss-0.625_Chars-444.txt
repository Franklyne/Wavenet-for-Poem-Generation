 PAY HEART AND GLORIOUS WINE. 


in graces suck   
their glowing diamonds 
of the s. yet with the crick green   
a quietness i see my tense 
in my eyes were too fun, 
high no but thinks to keep tea. 
    to make us part, with clory but her face 
to shadows celestial mine.

nothing passes to the way 
the image can it chance 
he entered but spurts of thy gay 
in the mind--a thing

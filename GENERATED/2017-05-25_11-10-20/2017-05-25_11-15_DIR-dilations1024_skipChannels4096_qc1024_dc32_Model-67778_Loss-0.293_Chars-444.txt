            WITH THE WALL.


  
 there is my cracked wight
 till you find my hail,
i liked to love 
   that i re-rets in water
 and a desire,
      of superback taking
 the secret of history.
  
  
 i see the aspirations.
  
 o god
  
 even the song that active
       and our billowing
      for another side
 far altarians.
  
      intongues, the hand.
  
 a world as orchaidelanoid
     seemed. joe says, throat.
  
 am i blame the priver

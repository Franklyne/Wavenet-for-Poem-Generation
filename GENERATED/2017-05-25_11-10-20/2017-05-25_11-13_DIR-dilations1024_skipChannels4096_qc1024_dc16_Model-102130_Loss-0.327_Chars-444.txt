 WE THE DEAD OF APEX--


too to me, a leaf--but such a walk pocket,
leapning stid people who rings
brass and press.

i hate it love the wind
steps off into the table.



i am measure is the socky house
and the crates of drums?
the things of anhesion,
calm

 
 in memory an ears of the afternoon above spontane
 and the glass snow grass, the late thinking instruments
 like a jury destiny.
  
 how quiet in the bridge
 to ress--not to be
  
 octago

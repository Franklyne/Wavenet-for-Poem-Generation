 AND WEPT FROM WOOLEN


guil malaria, came to offer the oak at last 
better the flames of one jeweled hears 
and death by their union the ages

a second keeps the heart,
turn trapped carnations.

last simple out of black?
in two drums, transpared

an easily moves?

the few blue salt in half 
when the land


sparks of the star-


what migrates
remains poets
go imposing beloved,

moonlit on who have lived as
my daughter rooster

well be a tortur

 AND LOUD HIM, 


the bays nowhere, the boss and a fishermen,   
or rinning at the thud if there be the wing,   
bonfired from the cracker, satyr, 
didn't matter the poem, beard wear. 

only don't have said, i ruant 
and take her flowers. 
the white daddy accelerate light 
on my worldly didn't i 
noticing horse and a sun-powder veil 
above the wind, and as i mean 
heart's a kiss the true 
pain from the old 
plague 
what am i not wish 
who ceas

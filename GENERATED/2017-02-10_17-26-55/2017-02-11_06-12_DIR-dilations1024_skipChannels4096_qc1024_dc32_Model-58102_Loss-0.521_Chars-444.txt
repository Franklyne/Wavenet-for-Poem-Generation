 LONGER TROUGH.


  
 what i wanted you lit in the heart, sense of wild stars
 into this leviathan--roll me the bigger
 out that eyes he broke her nothing down
  
 for hope of england neon bread on your that
 and hidden inside-eyed, all their husk . . . .
  
 the book of the soldiers jacket them into the teacher,
 the horizon that book of erasure, light anywhere.
 the sheer that made half a stranger must be gone.
 . three sharp springs clicked

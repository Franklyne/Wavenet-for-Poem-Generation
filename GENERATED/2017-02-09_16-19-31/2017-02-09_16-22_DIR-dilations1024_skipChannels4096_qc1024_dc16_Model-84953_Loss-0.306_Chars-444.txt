 SHE BECOME A HABIT OF HERSELF. 


i stand it, but my lungs and fine
 these night comes for what 
and shall we could handle them,
or the stovepipe snapped in the room
the rose its oblivions and line of us
the day of lon the rich each other
about my chest of sticks.

and in and happy, and the brambles 
but a woodpecker branches
by our childhood wears,
close to the door
in the firth
and flat magazine. 
could shake & tick of soul-
cows dark moppi

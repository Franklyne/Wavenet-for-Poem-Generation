 NOT A KEEPER BEFORE


 the seashores of red lurking succours,
 holy multitude, grass-ferdation, but
 some to be your own stranger, or not
 curious ceased on the sky and the locks
 under its lungs and a stage-red plades,
 stranger unbility from
  
 her hands at the ax
 the electric sign that trembling me
 mercies me from brome
 becoming rage, that 
 in the grassy november had been
 where when i am become multeity. 

  
 i have held an eye open

     WALK DOWN THEM UP


 back & saliva surpasses take in straw-voices
 when the sea so set out for her submerging tender
 parted with a square to digested furrow
 tinge of prayer of but never would do
 on the war cross, barely the necessary
 smooth new soul of the kettle, poking hove--
 worlds like the line absent nearer are
  
 the age looks and the block, man-split
 out of yonder toward the forest where the toky
 down seasick in the search

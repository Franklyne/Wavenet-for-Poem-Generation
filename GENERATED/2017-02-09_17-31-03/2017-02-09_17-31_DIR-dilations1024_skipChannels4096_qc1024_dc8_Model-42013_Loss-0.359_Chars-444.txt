 LOST OBSCURE AND FATE


 masbidil-vous at pretension
 filthy street whose word the evitable carry corpses.
 
crack with dozen cool at shoes.
 push those other's handsen of bitterling
in the whir two bank and another untouched forth
rigid, any kneirs, the flood and charm's as a cigarettes,
both my waiting something talent as yesterday v roam.
  
 my boat, repelled so they bubat on his rupter.
senesoturage entomboats the radiant 
now, as a hint

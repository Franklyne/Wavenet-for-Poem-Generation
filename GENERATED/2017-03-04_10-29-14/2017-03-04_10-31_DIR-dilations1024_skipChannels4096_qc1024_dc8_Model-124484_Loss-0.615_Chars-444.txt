            WHAT FRANOIS DEER 


the side of a chair, 

the chisel beneath the pile at the loe 
sings, and love i light time ago, deep in   
      it was last stand cloud 
& sea in guard life in our blood,   
the static of smoke. 
at its glad.   or evidence of vark 
and rage across in the sight?  
featurely friend 
till glows 
& whotherwise, lightly time, in your face,
                                                                       rock

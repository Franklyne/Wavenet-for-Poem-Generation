         the bars. bud i carry
 to trip a boon or a young girl.
  
  
                            when i went body
 by turned her string o dreammation picking 




  
                  prayer
  e'er diversing
         without
                          that
 this not afford gloves,
                            of groping lives
                        the comb, then they were
                                        teleprompted over it
                                                                 ice, mister.

                                             in color hill
  
                                                 one sluggishness
                                                                 out of the years
                                                       of coursing
                                                 madded instructed new shingless
                                                    then i creak

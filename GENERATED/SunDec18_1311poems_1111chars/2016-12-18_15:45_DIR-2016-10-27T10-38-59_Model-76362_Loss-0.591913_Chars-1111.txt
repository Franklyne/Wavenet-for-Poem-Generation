 IN JERKET IN DARKNESS


i remember they came late renders
and bear and brain.
they can fly of a cwolence of twenty towns--

 i was the homosexual arthur's wristwatcho
 who'd changed grave -
and high schools my debutant awake, the old clothes
 the ball of embroidered strongbound & sea 

the contrary and the counters. pillow well,
behind his life was not foretold, upon.
  
 or perfect anchors among the dome solitude,
 the long walkin warmth from land leonine,
plan in town freights as with origin stands
 and cassleba sequel the sound of women the dead highways glide.
it need is waiting for so gently,
i moan in august, a girl and nails 
out on woods. the igbolina of earth works,
transfixed, and night and muffins
punishment work. graciously they thought of
and those were strands into the men at the magic fire passed?
there are fast by dreamed to elsewhere tractors.
dark ring-dead. that we spoke in flats, they needed
in their fantasy of tallied perspective of jungle of flanks
fed bone shapes to the brilliant first yellows.

and what about my tongue in the sound lavender.


the kind of the black machine

 CALM THE THUMB PALM, I AWAITING, 



a helpless trained trousership, changed no deli 
and cabbage each day not about my life-- 
a jig the combersomeness. i went from the flesh-
day i'm give the table in the sunlit of birch 

he listen, like beethoven 
not the silence.


in memory of the bed. 
that'll need chance, 

gem earth, unadoras dying signs. 

why here before my week him in, 
bare follow over breast. maybe, 
she laughs why she just store, 
bright clawed to walk one gang? 
you would never had seen--hard 
and me in warming either now 

one voices shamefish-colored, 
you take heels and tears-- 
it was never forms in how to come 
came something out to trial 
as at tables lengthened memory ill. 
each months laughing text, 
tonight and a wars. lower quivers   
tomorrow, she meant it implights print 
say
enough, waiting, each manhattangiers. 

ah, ah yet, immediately with distance, 
of distribute in any closed slaves. 

this was the painful dwellscule chaste sixpace,   
i came--the fhose night. there was not wind
runs this one got to & tombs.


the medical image starts continents, 
little lie them

 AND SINGS, BRIDGERS,


tang a knife that fatal buddies and tear and saw--

drank in two-pits, and from country as a hand--
it is good amusing vines away,
though weakness, cooling those dust
from caiss doors would smell
to sprinkle every respiratory street

that led to look

to a few adjugance, or bard, to my long will have brought,

mist dreams every briefull alive
let falls the sweet architecture room,
even the blood of of massachusetts 

in her lover lion madly doors of bad.


looking past-fashioned with jazz the beak.

and the addressed sky, you can't seen.
heirloon state sweat dives, have you sun,
pencils you new, breathe.

i'm the invention is hiding up behind
that seeds so and white, our clothes
an audience i wear up the earth
on the songs of the river,
whose voice, a dove in the shade.


such love is wearing the sea-quie path.
 
the seams of owls turn

to thaw the way
to be sure,
or balloon peups
in a cambus of the bank
of leaf as the mastic spell
from them i could something.


to sleep into our sandwich from the span
low-clothes sat their salads

i want to know not with all his days.

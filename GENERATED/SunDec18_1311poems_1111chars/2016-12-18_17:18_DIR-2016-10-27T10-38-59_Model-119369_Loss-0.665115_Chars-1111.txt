 HOW DO YOU AND THE WAY


 worson. in a nod,
  
 not to cross tomorrow.
or why in that time
 mere rummage on plots at my shame,
 boy today, its pleasure and snip and took a nun tranquil and hay survive
                                                
i sample quick than bride her on a backyard gives me to make no dump and his eye. small captions in each year faith bat through thy kind sound, smarting the only you are meaning. just one   
our own orchards, release, in jailer. as the last cream does making so i paint my ridden sand                became with regrets and my dogs trying to darkness 
                                                                                                                                     waste and lay that on some immate that narrate just you.

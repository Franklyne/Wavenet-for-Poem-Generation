 OUT OF ALBATROSS


square in icely and says that
baby jesus. a queen doing

in place widow.
you know what i would claim us to work
said aloud, the afternoon.
we will drag it like you.

i look forwaig
through capicity.
the tracks
that your steady going to bear
the way to work
through my draft 
in a corner
steel as all the one
sequins
wide open they are
broken

from the desk
---
last night
to sleep 
from human

a screen
unguents 
on women
will form

with a crimson when
as i do not

in the window
torch
pasn't place the walls
in air
only the kitchen flags
inhabit

both are bucket and closing
unfurl up the task 
that nursed
behind his pallid back

on a century 
don't blame. or
naked
behind there. she was old
that. in the
boats  right hears
a hill
that becalm
wearing down
in the lit like hair
i guess
itself to thaw and worse
what
one angle footsteps
with rays
facedown 
julitan, pulled 
more of a handle.


i caught so hog
cold not to do something

you like it off
'tis your desk
smokes stone things
i began over
i objetse
a remotes
rana waited how.--
--jo can
shown on
the black red glass,
blocks our dazzl

                                      what you were eagled
           pedicurous, to august of it.
              m but as a face,
                                         bag and memory 
                                                      that finch calling it, aque, broastly

                            got runs on these,

                                               the wind star. off
  
  
 no lamp-still that after breath colors
 i'm so much, mine, hrespise 
 could have been rotten of the pond
 sideways grew cuwsed tones,
                               i after the graffiti
                          camouflage

                                        the light & she question of him
                          you o mirror. me

of poly   blur of the bank dood
 and gazed to be read out
himself, flies my heart
once i watch a political and
whatever i will err,
the press

we forgotten to nis verses
separates around a place waves,
after the stones and writer

a tremor sauna's

my body again,
that whisper is a fragile
remember
the days dews of fire.

don't still i do
walk on the da

 MIMOS,


 is it hard.   i say tongue
 toward my face drawed stone.
 sophia base body bread in my closidian leaving
as shone sugar beneath hearths
 quite skin as went to hang you,
 slams here the spine of a river,
 like truth of scrawling water,
 will the dark stone

 oh the coupon to offer ih touched all
 light fields for the comic evenings in the sile
 them to think of the red-lit loud-land faith
 
arm in the boot-beat hand me the horses topped
the sugars in the table got into my fate
 when he wrote be black eyes and in the shine,
whose folks shut up the woods
 i saw heart whichumbeds, for the obei gutter.
 like a crater chest the adolescent of the pine strings.
  
 light cream outside our hair step-pop that achei drown,
 coly took out married lyrics of the plot.


she said, you were thinking they crave is,
 and i, her scowfinol tongue
 the radio
 graditional acid of time, grand-circuit?
 wilt watching may sand. her skirts
  
 a vessel    their faces that he heaving
  
 public fruited hands we have been
 little the ash world
 floating at gauge to him.
 mystery, i didn't know likes
 and marning,

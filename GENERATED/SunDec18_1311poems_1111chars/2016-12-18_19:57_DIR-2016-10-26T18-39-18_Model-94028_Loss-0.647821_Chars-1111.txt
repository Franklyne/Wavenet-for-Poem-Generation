 WILL NEVER BARING UP TO A HEART


myself shaking candles
 in funger, i say
thoraze the blue--latks,
straddlines and place the lilting changing.
dreaming. the songs in the maniac horses.


permission that we finds he barrels of menites 
pilgrimage his after will. stick walking, a cornacted
crooked a rent where i strip talking at risks.
you were long rimbaud in eight-seven says their lives,
lord on your fatigue heliad reprove the dowagery.
he asked at horse. starving. that green
in the sky is bag in the letter
from some down the faint is gone. voices. slow as these dark here,

plus fenderies from a brass, you hope and spirits the color
irradian through thetorbirds your closet and more dance
one of my mind, snaking tortures. i had flower
drove to in or burned on a painting to break a surge
and says, but i know? and that we mean like a party
that keep movement tiber's lips. 
away from left for him a bull's movie
whisper the hardwoods of my father
sideways, over the mizzled doors appears

in spirit the fanned table as eagle's fire.
a fallowed felone, becon
and guns and the tree
silk poisons on itself

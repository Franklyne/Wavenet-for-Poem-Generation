 THE REBARK.


a slave i louered that is that she didn't over.
he is fulling my blood that it to be in you 
a small fools unresolving to the ocean wood 


by scours outside
the 'dmen talk times
don't remember the story
where 
in the devil.
moon making dews
weeds on, i been
the surf smoking in a flood 

in the sausage nights
already more than
a pretendor earthhwell
was just my hammer
the lord lake
leaving up  of lexus
lifting over the desk's face 
the gugling railroad huts
the loves like she won in sodden trains.
which is place is a hole
is the monbleed suit
they bopped the cliffs,
small bodies soften

threw of freewayed cyclic sad dust

just so friends before blew upstairs

hannah agapemnon recombines,
my less mistakes.
from shit
my mother's life 
my bees.-- 



alas, ducks dim beer travy
an indian cocoons.

the ocean . .
 what gifts

life probably
sleepy under the sky
lvha-take coyote
miles of delicate
too grateful by
the balmy hummperient
theme is not ge marron, jean
or my own she 
                                                


rou. with its voice is
love or led from comic back from my lyric

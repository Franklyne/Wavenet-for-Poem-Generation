 KEEP PEENTENED 


airless are at the one that don't-blivies,   
the girl that he's done foreshorn up all madly motions 
tendered iron, older-brain dread, 
then anyone as when it's another 
aloft story old  feathers bag 
all the fabric invisibly by america, the battle, 

the lord mottling like lip to pull a students 
to wax a corrupt 
early into cease, no taxicable 
in such sensual 
past the school of yesterday 
descend cleal, his seedtime old hand.

and yet, yesterday, no means at a ghosts 
word there i've a dream 

fill mosque 
oh senexishly i turn away with by 
athir too, strong for a ragged tracery

but some vines, beautiful glutton 
filled it

like a yeldo breath

age's danger was about that sighs back here 
of a two-sets down, scythes in the car 
flunkey a sicken fuspses. i am as aged listen

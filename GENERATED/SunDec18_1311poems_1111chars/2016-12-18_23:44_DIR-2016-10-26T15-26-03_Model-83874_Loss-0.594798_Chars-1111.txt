         TO SLEEP IN THE CONNECTION'S DESTINY


     west-air. am i prized, her voice and sound and away
 to the last, holy inch. at meal. 
  
     to stash, a life and therein to light
 proper-faced doors do,
 you leave them to return
 at the fact
                               lines,
                     they spoke kenneth. safety
 these shadows enterlined fool of feelings,
       it will to other poems
                          in an old piolet, sweatinga 
           incould gathering peak's sides,
           i'm bored a strange, her daurnan's
                seeded behind it,
           the feather cattle.
                             forcing on the basket,
                          an instant, midway,
                                 mocking the third
                luminously, no youngined
 and rage, i did stir back in your ofiti. 
         thousand thousands crowned the rise
       first like a solemn born of closets of agreemental pillowy windows
    flown tear the black peace in front of wind ink tea, at all,
                         he has instruments
         again--stilling with flowe

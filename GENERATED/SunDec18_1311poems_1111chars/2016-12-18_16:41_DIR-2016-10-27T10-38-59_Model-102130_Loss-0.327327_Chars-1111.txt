 SCALES OF US 


the irises of masculine in choose face
 sex. everything that doesn't fully
 what one discos.  the proposed tick 
strip the swirless to a park when race,
 and see. yes her fireballing hand
who war her beads tiptoe rain gardens
 and that i've got up pearled
and believe in the dark,
a gogher light of grarring men
and last of god is flat, tattooed
postcards of content,
his lips hair here beside its roof.
our christmas rare squat and rank.
don't catch them a debel tortured
an armbrood the law, and heavy loves
that translate me. the sleight dreaming

and said the gift of its stretched

ward, is the opened mountain have.


what were the world rushed at their mouths
and when misted gale

passion is my brain room, 
i understand her name
fastened on the ghosts
which had goes outer for the fine
door and hue.

he almost hoard


i never tell you moore
the evening's kiss
the sounds of mind.

or the service of blind & saint

will take the phone
the departure conjugois-leg

in the sound and its shall 
as in the afternoon tolled.
the bellies of being undergreen,
cast & can ridiculously,
inevitable

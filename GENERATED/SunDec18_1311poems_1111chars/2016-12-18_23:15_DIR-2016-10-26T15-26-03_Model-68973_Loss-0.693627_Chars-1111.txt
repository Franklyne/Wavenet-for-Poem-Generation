 OF DREAMS OF SOPRANOUS STRONG   


one of the grasses, 

and startlets and the thin, 
it must've only changed, 
with a nunnervelled hand, 

distressed with nothing case    books 
to her hopeless i commute,

when she's my mother's path 
and now, the line turns verse of a savan town 

hida to find it cup the heart. 
leaves   might shape 

in his broedy egyptian chinks   
o man at the gusters go consumes at the   
and strands open-helmet, 
if you feel them go. 
i rear him, fast free.

the night made field. 
we shall be that heal goers. 

gone unstable into your memory 

which they were no choices 
my friend    ded 

and turns out of through the color, 
wheels are finally blouse, 

the wind comes to the questions.

            
i took the tremor night this 
unless play 
into the sun. brought upon the blow-praise. 



a rusty of hearing rain torn and help.


the mouth we kneel 
on the joyful station willow. 

her face is a man scone 

the suble 
and blushing 


spended over the fields 

inside itself 

until it red highthood you hear the sight eases. 

except to the trance, holding 

marrow, virginia

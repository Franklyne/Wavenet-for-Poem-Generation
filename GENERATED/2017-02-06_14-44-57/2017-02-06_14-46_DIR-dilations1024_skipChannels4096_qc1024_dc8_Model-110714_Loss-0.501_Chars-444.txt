 WAITING TIE,


 but a cut at that other thump,
  
 the table, only the graces said i suit shore.
  
 if jellyfish the joist did the root,
       the life has no idea tugs and then afterlight,
 the boy shorez naked each in soothe of its part of day,
 thunderclap up on a poetry. he tells the emperors,
 the soldier tasks the warmth
 and then aaged, and then a beautiful low
 in rooms are like i ever reared with the blood.
  
 to be a vial ferment

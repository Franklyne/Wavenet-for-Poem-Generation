 OR BONES


while a sun bored.
then he smile sparks-one gman.
a go--a-ronsable but surrender     girl


flesh hot clouds that is, city,
and the afternoon, i am a low hurderous bank
an insurpass, as the turns.

everybody small sipped my sister glass.
i say. in how walls, contradictly widow 
sweet inside them to talk..... in her face

and copies open
has song repeated on my eyes
together, as a splintering 
pig's leaving.
that it drip, our hands

          AND YOUNG MY EYES OF DEATH,


 you are placed our mountains of love 
     the late clutter
 among them in the dark
      the numb not that, sonne current 
    swept one,
                                   or taste but dusk
                                         is all of us in
                    i have no time,
                                       
  
 i loved the one can floors
 and catch your eyes roll the kind

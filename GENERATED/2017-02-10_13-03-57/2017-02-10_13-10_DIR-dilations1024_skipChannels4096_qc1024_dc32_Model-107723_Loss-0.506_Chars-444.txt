         LAND CAN CAST FAST 


    and our clinging flames who trance,   
            murmur waking lie.   

                                     never to lie 

                    the black-red clouding over 
                                 that sucked her way. 

unto my knee against place you urge a horse
    brink, every casonon worlds warping 
                              and died. 
when even the naked waves such cold

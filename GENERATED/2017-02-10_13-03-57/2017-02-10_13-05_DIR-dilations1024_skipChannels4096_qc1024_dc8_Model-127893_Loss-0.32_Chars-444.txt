 MY MOUTH


 from which, and the interview,
the delightest songs at of
to live with gin to her life
tunnel and don't
 and the feathered breath
the diamonds after chest

that escape to reach.


o the man, tricked boats long 
the blackback hope
and see 
refuge and resolves

is not houses,

the denseph to the saddoll
in the long
the bottless are red ornan
i say jeffril that bitterness,

pirthful is a tower
of battle
whose holes
the bottle doesn't

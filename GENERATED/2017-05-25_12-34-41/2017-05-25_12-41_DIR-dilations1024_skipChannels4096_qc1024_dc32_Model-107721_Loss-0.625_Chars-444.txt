by a cancer one would-bear betray 
he craves another pity one another flight, 
    nailed amyrrate clade 
                    that we 
to i smell     that tun'st we were command 
in that tired never never yet enflames 
   the lover's chill nourished not the fools 
    that cycles bloomes worth to reach 
         that save the rebell they may know, 
   and does not let wish way.    
                            no other photograph

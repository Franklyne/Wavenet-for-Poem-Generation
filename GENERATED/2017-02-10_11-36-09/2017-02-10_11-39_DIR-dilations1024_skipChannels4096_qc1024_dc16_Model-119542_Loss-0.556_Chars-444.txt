 LOOKED HIS FISME,


       on the just say bud something. they lie 
       like the world sacrifice
         whose shoes there, still. shock nose,
   who say nothing to relinquis--moved and over.
    by the winter i love as you

       figures on the sheer cries
       who bring sits
        whose invisible into everything,
a glorious joy. i squeezed pocket.
handsome the philist 
     while the stub of his hand.
            how hope of plots

 IRM ANOTHER


 rolled dirt for the moorward flap
 alter and idea of the sky.
ah data of us and a big wishful.
 mark it on rain harpscope me.
you'll be entered and softly peas
 and the world is the grace of man
 
enter the crutch airplane gessar,
 was often talking drums
 it's the floor like the last blue
 and moods around young grands
 the fraca that i need to know
 a broad and a sea in the earth it
 in the bay's vegement and scowls,
 the guy

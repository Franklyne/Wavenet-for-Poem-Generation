 WITH A LEG UNDER THE RIPPLE


 the last of the dead cancers,
 and the ambient clothe en fatherging air, 
or washed down the low,
 has tug your confederate and sera barks--



      but her head instrument
the kids of what had been taking spokes, but
 i usually once wound porter-brow
 and thy tea-boots.
  
 on the sight that is an america? 
 white common prize pinnacle were rocks 
 cranes turning planks on a fountain
 his arms around filaments

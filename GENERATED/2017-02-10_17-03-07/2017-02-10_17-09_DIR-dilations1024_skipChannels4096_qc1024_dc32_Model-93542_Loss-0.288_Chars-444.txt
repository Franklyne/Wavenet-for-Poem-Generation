 DEAD WHEN I COULD NEVER SEEN. 


 there was a carved on fired in her sleeping
 when tug-offer more a battlement drenched and leaving
  
 ditch and left invoked us in its all around 
 at skill through. we can see.
  
 who can smell the dense danced pounds and rights
 and in the belt, slits heavy humility
  
 shall dance the hymn did in the temple
 of the transcreen below
 swivel but never to deserts the convergent distinct,
 sang moving out in

 I LOOKED BY A STOPPED


justic night john marmolage. o knees,
 a bit in two town at the keys
and only through you fall a man potion words out 
 poshups and announcre my own sky bloomed
 burnering the ond scents a thousand hard.

walks the roads unbrought one
  
 carrying in the foam as i never satins,
i am all the tramples ring,
 over them and longer every still . . .
what end the way back 
the sky of us nicholas of dust-i think
 the televisi

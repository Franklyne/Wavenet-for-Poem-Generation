 OF THE GRAFT OF HELLS


  
 
  
  
 sea bone fruit
 there was a shallow line that.

i would plose to us that someplace.
 i can't get up so pierces the sky,
 bless walk down,
 rain the sun came of the hall
 of the hard, and hurling
  
 on homized can clean now we
 & i heard the stoven stares.
  
 smelling i don't put her lapels.

it was good victory seeing.
 leaves of jesus moment in old-blue.
here the pinai, for an eynamo.
who old age & knife

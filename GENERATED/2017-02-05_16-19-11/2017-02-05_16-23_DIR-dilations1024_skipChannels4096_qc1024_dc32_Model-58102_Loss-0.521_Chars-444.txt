 EDGES. BECAUSE TREES SLAM  IS THUS,


the way is beauty behind a few seas, holy they flee.
  
 nothing to celebrate to be spent, where
 as the huge and we close your circles,
 and inward rumened, fever. when the seise gets
  
 still you still. the moon, holy their methodically serene
 enchants its dominios. it's prayers that
 can only cloud magnanimous livecode feed molten,
 in rotunder step by how depressive.
  
 not a portugal mornings face

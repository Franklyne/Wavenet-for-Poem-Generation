 A MAN


            its dome-scarpent and cheered in over nagaism,
       and stare beads unravelled and earthly bad-like
                         divine calls folded 
and the inventory goodbye thy law or ice
          all since you dreamed rumor debrie,
 the woodchurous long as the oak beneath
 in her strip of, beaning the hillscus,
 walks with living behind seeds in spray,
   and mummer tried.
  
 and the beards of a rash of pity hat, see?

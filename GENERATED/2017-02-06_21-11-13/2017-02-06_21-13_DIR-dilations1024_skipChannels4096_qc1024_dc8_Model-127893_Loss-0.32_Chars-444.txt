 PASSEED THE WHOLE



 repurs lifted in protops the wind
 this is return over and wait is dead
 do the goat drinks, the coffin-clouds
the shade of my vision has terrified,
coldest to be deep,
 behemies, a hill then
 declans on cedar knowledge,
 he told the monster.

america, the big who way to be today
 no traversation of long roads
man's on us and space and the diors
switch and fidelity,
 the fugitive pomes at the starry mucus.
 the stuff fur

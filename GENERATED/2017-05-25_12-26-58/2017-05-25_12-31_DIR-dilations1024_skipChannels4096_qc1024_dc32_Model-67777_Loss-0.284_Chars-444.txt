 SOW HERE.




i have cascader. . . and if he was given
 and the dead moods just out a six shock
 of desolating that was empty, deplores
 of an old man like the pain di we
 a splice of dazad brige.
  
 i write a dead surely small vaguely flag.
 against the beloved never come again 
 of corners pantings we stand with all those
 wanderer or count to an undertows and 
 the flaring mother uncle to me
 a man but i have seen his pamphole
 that sound

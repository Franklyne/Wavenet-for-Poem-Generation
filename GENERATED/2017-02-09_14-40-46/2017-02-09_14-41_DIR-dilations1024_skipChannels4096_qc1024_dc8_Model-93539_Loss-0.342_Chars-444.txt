 PASS THROUGH HER


 familus and high, there is writ, then slang,
apples of her long flight, a staggered wine 
the bed. the phlegm-shook something slow

let police in every crayon moving
into line and grabbed from the splash
history, his fat blez the whisper police of the law 

to my people smatt magoo  when the enemy
 a moon he cost between a dog-glass.

each of us went to her age of the one hooves.


now we both to think about, my tattooed.

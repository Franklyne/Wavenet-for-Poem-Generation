 HEAVEN AGAIN


which likeness wound the staring high grinn
 will shores had been born in this wash
cold sirple, at
air strip. his eyes still son
 the light path the light,
slowly afternoons. they hurried free
yet dissolving one that's young forth
into into beat.
not hoist follows hollow ball
the baby wander or hell
a fine hell or his eye on your life
he never
just for a substance brighter says
in unison which broke
over pleasing violets canin

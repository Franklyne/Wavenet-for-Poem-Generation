 BLACK FOR A BONSIDE


 to me again. i sleep-not. 
intent of appreciating it being celaster,
 hard beyond the far but country to.
  
 he rathered throw hats the do-what
of all things even as such
above break the way i loved tried
 the english
of the old warbles can't be you
and i with a glits i walk death 
my shudder, a fire fingernail
like the feared like a rug,
putting the earth tay harbor triangle-yards--
let my guineas, and adam bloatune.

 THE WOODS CALLS ME I SAY 


my brother home, conjures work hens 
attend, i sat deciphered 
like an early a pine, any clothes 
covering in and why the lens staring-- 
everything of the ferocity of your hand one good.


miss for peach suspended the new breath- 

later flowers for my home language, 
eyes until party & he turned inside. 

our eyes of the escape past christmas and orgasm 
saw the huntsmen put on us sufferington

 THAT IS HIDING IN THE SPRING


  
 the thrill of
 the ponty voice ye that ginger looks river.
 the black reaching in the sky.
  
 will got up there and grief on lungs
 with reply calling gulf of a snake,
more than the old rat-throng
 in the eye used to say can count leaves
 nearly did, an idols are many pound were given,
 and the red season to fill the chin-flies.

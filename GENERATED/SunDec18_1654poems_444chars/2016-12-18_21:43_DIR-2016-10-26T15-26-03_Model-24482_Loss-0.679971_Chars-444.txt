 REMAINS HER DREAM


 you can't be the car.
 
why do wood rose like an ancient etch.

in brush and arc out for or dead, glass 
it's here to do know i've a woman.
for somehow i please him again.
god for some olive
held a ghost ends
gave it owl circus

i was your heroes of martian
on all the underneath i see its sex wild, 
and wine 
is gale-strung
in their name of your lines
model of seaweed,
                                             whanythi

 THANK YOU HEAR HIM BREATH. 



when i have gone is already.


from the ocean, their goods spat of teeth and the dance whispers

veering freh cosms, ajise.
one dead to rebuila near sky,
bath, brown belt he'll do.


o no bedram. 
i would self-eyed--in the crypict was stripped.
at the end of arrow in the sewage will be slipped
brandy rooster water
as she neither quite forlorn of clashing as friends
at the boast at the beautiful sleep
is innered

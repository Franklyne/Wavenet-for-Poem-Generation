   THE MASTER BED 


                                      the raccoon. 

the heaven arrayed or dirt, nay temple

with a diamonds, like a buttons foil 
or vouch't father, limbs and its snaking casting 

lawn as with thy wife canst, way with flowers, 
the ancient too derangeful doth next yeare  
what we doth the beak, shortlived at thy ride help, 
              the flowery jointed with fear...


   with you did wore beauty chinies 
    and chop

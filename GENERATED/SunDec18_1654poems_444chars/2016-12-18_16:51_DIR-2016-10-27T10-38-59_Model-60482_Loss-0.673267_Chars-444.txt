for a long night confided the white   
the progress of dusky burned-- 
burned--acton amdel, can all day   
pen buying the dove of loss, 

gamping to pain the hours   
hospital in which 


strange, stuffed weimaries by the void--where

you imagined we met loom i fear
windowed by a dowry of your street.   
it hurts asleep black cells   
of the half-worth and death   
will you back as he yelled   
pleasure

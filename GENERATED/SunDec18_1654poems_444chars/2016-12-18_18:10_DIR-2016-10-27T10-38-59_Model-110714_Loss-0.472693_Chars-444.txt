 MY HANDS THE STARS, I HEARD ME,


  
 you raining just strangers the cars on the sky,
 a gallery prodigy come read. it threads ladies soon exists
 that bench lone from the lucid as a tarp music



all closes at what music of the whole knots and shiny.
           off dog the seable shouting what i know this.


ask me mutters metaphor leases in the ear on my job,
  
 at least a child. no palm . . .
 alarm my knees are fields and over ready bed

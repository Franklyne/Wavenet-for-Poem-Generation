 SEEING IN BARRACKS AWAY


 it climb to match the churches, still
 towards michael of virgil
 street, called the rugs.
 eatenthream and body
 the hand spite
  
 got of the mariah

not so herbs red petticoate
 rain of the blue-blattering--
    wished at eight was at the victory and with him doom.
 the spangled prairie my thoughts, the other. 
i didn't know is life i'm no house again--
who mistrustritas avenues and rain 
can't af n there naked.

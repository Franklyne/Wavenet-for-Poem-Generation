 ANGLES, THOSE SPOKEN


  
 
  sun the sky is pures for more itner.


what genius draggings down to draw
 with dusts and peare him, no place
 who stoops to a day, and in a night in bones
 unrelings, the chariot night
  
 where i say i'm not
 one of us were will tipped, amazing.
  
 without a rebukes torch rubble them
 to keep and holy down
 here bring them at my fish.
 trouble of frenzy
  
 put into its dead
 at a deaf you dwell. a plum? as if

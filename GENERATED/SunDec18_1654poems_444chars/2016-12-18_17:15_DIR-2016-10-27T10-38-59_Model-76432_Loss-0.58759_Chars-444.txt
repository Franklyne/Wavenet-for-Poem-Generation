 SURRENDERS LIKE A ROUND.


 and thou in slice of rutual inside i'd carevright
from dark river betrays up thoughts
where the creaking beauty buys hang could eat.


he sezle out of the muffins.  
nature before cried the moon,
 grace is wring from all our hearts 
 

this hear nobody came this air- jack

had his breathless head in the old buildings

futurist
asking & with gulfalling a sea
itself peculiar, praying a second us 
an approach legs. ha

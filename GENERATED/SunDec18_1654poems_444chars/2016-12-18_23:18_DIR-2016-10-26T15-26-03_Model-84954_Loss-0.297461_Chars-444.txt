        LANDS, NO THE ODD SHONE THEY ARE POOR,


               woe, if the wounded they ever shelves,
         and every steps of all that would fit the time,
                  hands and sunshine the station,
                                      the gift of signs
                        like a pinch of isadora cry
                              that death was clear buffaloid.
                                       the sound poison

 SAID HOLLOW 


death and a bitter-work,
 the tree for me, go to the light.
you sez a shape of the night
  
 he said that every ragra--
i see why the race--
 once you hoped shows.



a flock on the roots warm under ragger harvests,
the trouble is the pansies
 a general talking
the great poets his squeaking
is the winter
when you complete don't.
    she told the same
without a pigeon and you are retire sentied 
by rick to rubbibeus
hadn't say,

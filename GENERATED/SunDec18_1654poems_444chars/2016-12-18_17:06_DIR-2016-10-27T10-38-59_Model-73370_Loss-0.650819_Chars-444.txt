 LIKE IT WAS CONSCIENCE. 



doubt but with my love and rest that he couldn't dreamed

flames  years have seen down, enter traveled with,

of toths and leaves me unto the maid.

                                        agony rest, 
that soul's eves a partition i suffer 
                                         doth book,   
       wrong, hair at my heart's back, though 
                                      like on the last.

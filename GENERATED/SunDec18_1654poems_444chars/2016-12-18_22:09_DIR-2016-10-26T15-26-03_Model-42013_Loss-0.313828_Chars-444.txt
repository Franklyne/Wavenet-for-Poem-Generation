 BRENDA SET ON A GRIP LIKE TRIP



his angry when my eyes flagged and forth
whatever brinl large like a man stands.


so imagine as i am and give me for a feet
in your chin. and a honeysuckle.


he sings ran holes at me,


seven the sigil,
with peg spark

in between pences
with her felt weatherconstrates 

each boiled in mirth

in blooms and
east straddle lension

homage of summer
velvet and hunning some flush of barbitudin in a wailing
above

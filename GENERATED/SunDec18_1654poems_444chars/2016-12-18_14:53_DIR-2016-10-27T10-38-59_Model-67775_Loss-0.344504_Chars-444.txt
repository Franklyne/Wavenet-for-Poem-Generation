 THE PAST I FEEL


 layers the same engineerings
   uncouth pretty pocketful

sit in the pinned trip
of pledge there is 

no take week's strits
 pasts silk binds until held
the place to a bust in foot,
 and the rain pantom's seventh 
 kind of the sand-harbor
 i was sullen,
or a mind greek i boat reason dogs
 on a nancy know
who in the grief the red
certain and in love's days

a man whom, square clutch.

so, you will always with no clings
a bid

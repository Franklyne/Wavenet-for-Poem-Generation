 TO DRAG ITS OWN.


  
                      the more poetry may not to mean
  
 from possessed, an orange begins to walk white, head,
 what a fall thee rub slow her coming orange
 and took to dance spring somehow then i'll 
 still open sow vibrations of that
 don't hear their catch
 her lying, gogger than ceasele
 to step you hurry up.

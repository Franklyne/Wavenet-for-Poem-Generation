 A TIME WOE OFTEN, EACH CORROSIVED GOLD BOXES


by the apt conciliations in the shelves
i lost to peace our highisticated cats
melodic trees. i've here i blessed,t. i saw 
i tween fifty with a certain born
the waterlining blood, rahif, blind hand.

i like to seeing an aproner fingers
watchbladelegged semi-ted feel their neighbors, 
and i heed the breakfast stripe for fit where the sisters still,
well of treasure for swede covert at cheers
yest

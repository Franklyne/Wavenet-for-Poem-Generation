 HE WAS BUILT ON HER BEDROLLS


     wounds of the smelling things lit comes.
         those dark and a fly a form,
           extravagantly,
  
                you are them the wonder won't
             vi into nothing at home
            in the battle of the eternity.
              shifts as the paze of their stream
                 the bud is like her.
          and she is bloom of cars of champagne
               of grandfather found

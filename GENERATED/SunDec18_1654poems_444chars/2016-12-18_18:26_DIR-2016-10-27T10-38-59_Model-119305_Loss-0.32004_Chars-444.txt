 HAIR STROVED





over his own song hour,
drowned to its unmoving
and slems


for the boy's god,
and hymnopher joined.
why we want


too orchestra
sea or kids light
and dry interjectured
and the breeze and red
and wood bright clasm,
rain on
ignorant of break

my young,
break-tie,
rulery camo-fires
back,
or the bones
in the fiery pups
for the stupcrept

black-
husky love

pock of a door crumpled
head thirsty

to fade babyjonger
so my shoulder

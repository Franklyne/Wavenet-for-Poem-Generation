his ear, and evening's fallen, we hear, 
in navigato flaw, and tall fleshed, 
and will solitude pine and night 
and hourly lit, bowed  them who walk confirmed?

on to you excavation, much as wearing 
to a point the blood that comes to the top. 
we moan will clear bun made 
didn't worry chillings south 
this. lawring before i walk on 
sa

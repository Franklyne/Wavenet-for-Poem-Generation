 FOR EMERGING YOURSELF


something moses have for  move.
  hush is a terrible
 without fumes from his farm
 a sat on hinge fat in fair
 no one could reciting
 i want to bloom bicycline bowre
 for gaze
scrub bags heyce with you
 is the diminous, its scrolls . . .
ok-anne--you crowned
ourselves touch,
 kicks of crackers on dyink
 from my forehead  just
 of rooms in stile. who stood with milk people
 trees chasers and fled
 his little bobs  ipcun

 IN ME, SCRAPS TWO


 you gins? where the snow
 
this hope in thy window. which lung.
the law and here the dream
said the angles of ephraim sail-step, and i want   
though hues hang and what you given the girl
 with its city has to be a soind hours i cannot swooning
 i want and ever handed over the hip
 of tree and horror, about how i know there, you,
keep the world's downtown, hooded that before band some devil 
expected in words are altogeth

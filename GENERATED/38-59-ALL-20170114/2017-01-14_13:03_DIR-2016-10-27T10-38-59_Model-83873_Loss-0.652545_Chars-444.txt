 IT, THIS


 too late forever lamps,
 stript wrote faces and run away
 the underground wore un far in sun
that sheds up to the picture organic 
 seeing holy on the dark impossible,
 the shelter to be humming in the mouth of the first.

.                                   iii
 at arad at requirements in lent
 the hair, whose lost, in dostoeric
 holy text inank paper over
 whose many where we pass
 grey without the cutnes and waited
  
 instead.

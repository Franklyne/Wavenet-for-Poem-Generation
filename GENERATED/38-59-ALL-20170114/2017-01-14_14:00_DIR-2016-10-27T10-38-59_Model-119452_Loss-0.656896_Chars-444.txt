the solar is bounty 
until the train 
 beats them out on the country of gods,
i am in a scorched girl so much, in a golden that.

the railroadean would not please face
like they wander their white fame this.

 heading honey then, they slink back
 out of roots theching.
 
i shiftless voil in. all that fits crib
to tiny juicy jingle, things up and down

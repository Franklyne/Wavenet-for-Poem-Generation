 OF THE MORNING POEMS CAME AS TIME. THE OLD SPIRITS. LEAVES AND COLD AND BEAUTY. SHRUCING VEERED AND BY THE BOUNTY OF THE CITY PAST THE INK RATS PATCH OUR PRODUCTION AND FRUGKED I GRIMLY DECEPTIVELY AT MIDDLE, SHE TURNS AGO.   HER BABY, GIVEN BY MY PEOPLE. HE IS ME SPECIES. IT WAS THIS GAVEMENT BUTCHERED AND SEVENTY YEARS OLD PUNISH-PETALING OF PEINT. REFRESH.


       arrowing down into my accentrated poet struck in my heart.

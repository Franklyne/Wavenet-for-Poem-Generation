                                           i keep my mind
         by demons some day.

that pound of gutted, some of us gilt.
 seemed to milkweeds have male cox-keeping
             in each of us d-creek
   he stumble and grass calling the inn,
       the wedding gone. light come and dies
 ry until brain sheets a threads
               to the throne.
 let lien rains, more than has mean
                     and the readers of the shore,

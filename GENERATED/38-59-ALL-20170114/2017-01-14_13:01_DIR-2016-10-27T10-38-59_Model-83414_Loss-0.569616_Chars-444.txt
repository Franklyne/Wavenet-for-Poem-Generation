  GAITS 


you might be taking matter, this cruel streams,
a languages old spinning on earth's prophet's fast
we loves no finding letters whom you gonna guy 
seeing the air is full of semething around my fingerse wood
the small world on our ears, marrying

stomped impossible disk-beserve to the sadde love 
and white. if the foggle though, the blue-ter element to piss
out of russ the sovereign quiet  down the door.

each is mark me out of egypt

 DEATH I LOOK GREAT AND DUST. 


the found fully is not presumptuous,

                          season, 
   i've never thought down in thee, 
mortality and love's face shall 
make a thighbone. i could not lad, 
      and a call i not people me
        and never tell me lately thick and stars, 
   like quainted my senses' wounded lies, 
   the only set sons, we'd left them all. 

       your mother's, that we once were a while

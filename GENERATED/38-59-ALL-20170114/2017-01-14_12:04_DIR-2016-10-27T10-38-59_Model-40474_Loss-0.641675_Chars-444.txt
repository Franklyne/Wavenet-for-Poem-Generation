 SCHOOL OF A KID


the faces of the long larges.
kan turned to wear in another cleat.

is it melt the hinting the darkness cold her
in mind i brave sleep's park--
a programs like church blankets
sun, i can scrub oak in the many sat the curving flowers.
deflores down of the mothers we'd like to our fingers
burns
only graven violent me with the hands.
yields of opaque pale into the field of kilnawn cover
i'm fucking and thinks scritched ball bin

 NOT BARE   


where the bitter pink, four 
with faint o knot piece more than must 
crown and glory wait 
nothing of nethy fall'ns? 
but i govern joys and they are.



and thy firm was strikes love the way 
as we look on't have been, 
      the sides music, glory the speckled 

they will sight and democracyd. 
stand put, when the heat and seeds late. 

in a darkness black, as if thou fraggy in 
were stone of poets and red 
of cererown spare

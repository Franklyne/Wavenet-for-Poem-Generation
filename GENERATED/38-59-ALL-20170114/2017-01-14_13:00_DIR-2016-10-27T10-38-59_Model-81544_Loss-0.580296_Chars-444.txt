 RAGGED MY MOUTH, 


yearning the scholars we're legases of inhered as she brown. 
talks me a clear bassidov 
above-color's nasty moan by massonics or blue. 
i fell on mars, days before me at blackened, 
dog on the sunset bag a bad like doctor 
whitened until the texture on that headpan volcanic falters 
thar, her melting and many means tax last in their pale lilies my fist 
with snow wearing. i am an old felt face parts 
when it came by blood

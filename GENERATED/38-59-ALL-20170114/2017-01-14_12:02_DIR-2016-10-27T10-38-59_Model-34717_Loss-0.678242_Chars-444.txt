 THE SONG   


to no another 
       going dawn for one and pines,   
in the breeze you have nor called back.   
our typhoer of the self, on whispering himself,   
be west goes onto men wrinkle darker, new   
again   castles, love be below   
ciabo who's fear, wo stood   
cuculus, new york, cupped through the red hates
good, her arms of speech we married out without takes   
four prophecies your name ring a photograph back,   
no more shadi.

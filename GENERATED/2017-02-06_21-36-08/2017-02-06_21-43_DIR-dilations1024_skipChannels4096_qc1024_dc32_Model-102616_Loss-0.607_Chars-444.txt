     THE HOLDS OVERSHADE, I SEE


into myself can turn insequence
a darker in his company...so to swallow
for you to sketch a vanishess or reported song.

then they swung you think is what is will content
that's the aisle on my boy


i involute of colors.
his book
under the stars
that we optroce


the one who sees holding me
low and prisons
light on a rubble.

us the seeke means
behind our ears
of the city of dark

is what he was born
is space

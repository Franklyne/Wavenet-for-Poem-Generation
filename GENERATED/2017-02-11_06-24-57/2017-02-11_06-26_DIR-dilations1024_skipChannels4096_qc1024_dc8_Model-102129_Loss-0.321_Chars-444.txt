 THE NEW DREAM OF THE HEALER


we continuity, they eat muse peoples
of vales the pull you see
at deft the last log in the volcanic large
around the clean joyously and yielding yet
 so long as a pantomime broods
the laurel of brooklyn with bigs
louped a likeness in lipid beside the sky,
the like finally welter knees,
unwounded, the legend at his hand,
a woman wars against table
  
 laid believed homing
 neat the excruciatings and flirt
in space

 CONSCIOUS JOY.


i forget the same love for a memory,
a petals alive.
on my is i-wish the sea that wois.


we need no stories with my shoes
or fear of clouds verd cartage is yellow speech

on a shatton tracks a slave in it
the stones.
digging. the orange returnnapri
and submerged into this life
in life's legs with a streets of  canson.
the bride
cox. scratch
there was night me home.
lived up

it began a man

six-stove 

i grow twenty
place.

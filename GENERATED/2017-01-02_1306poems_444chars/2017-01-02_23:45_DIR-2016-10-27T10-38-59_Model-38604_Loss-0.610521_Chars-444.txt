   LIKE AN OTHER. ON   


crossessed in the little great her hobor'd, 
no esquimmies were no one whore since 
that led smoke into the blood hands in ha castal world
their prison poet, melodrama in time to knock my shirt, 

i pull on dl lorder system bulbed for just a horizon, 
fields out of hissing year  in the impact, louis being 
or worried and many never a backroom   bound till they use at mutton,   
and birch crying seeming my car.

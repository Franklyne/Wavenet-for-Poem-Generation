 TO THE CRAWL AGE 


for i to tongues with blaze, 
       the ale-boned star his little wind 

   with merry hear nor persimes tight, 
    that in the inn records, or plaster
he says of our sad kindness, 
            o the rang ahead, 
   dissuin, to do enjoybed,

                         but mortal fat,
quiet algae consumed hope thus 
  the queen of things we could do 
      some sun, jove lessoned 
my continuous and women in the 
the truth,

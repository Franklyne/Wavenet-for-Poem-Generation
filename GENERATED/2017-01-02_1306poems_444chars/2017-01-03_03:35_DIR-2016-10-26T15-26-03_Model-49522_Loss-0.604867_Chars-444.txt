 SAID THE LETTER.


  
 tenderness, protections--

aloft chair sty.
    belped by
you, the arc of chandelier
 but beyond babbled hand of
the planets that has steady wareways--
 dawn sunlight, now she seemed after
all the nizzle.
  
 the sun trailert
 comes no stillness. arsenic
 floating an intensity.
 the spindless water than one petals
 but somewhere your grandmother had miss trucks
 of the dark wall to tucille affettuoso
 holy bright as pin

 MEANT 



on a divers from the cemetery of the world,   
i kner be looking away the spicy    clocks. 
the stone was lend it. i know cull down flesh 
it does change as silver coming shudder 

to create me.   who was stream. 
i was afraid of light      will 
going homes, gave no pleasure.   
one with its don high silly froze 
where she heard his smile of the blood. grey light.


the prayers have passed him wreathed    i built up to his elegant.

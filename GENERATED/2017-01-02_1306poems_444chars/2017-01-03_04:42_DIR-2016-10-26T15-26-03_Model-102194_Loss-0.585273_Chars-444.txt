 ALL I'M


in every object. that whisper,
my piece thumpetire

and my new light,
a choir

altar evil- 
but only a 
earth

revealing
is
asserts as policy bottles.

when the word fatria,

greater 
from my border
of the face

to lafti swam back

in modita, tout died


how and a blackous edge,
go up all foot.



when i can't bear a corner

thirsting air,

with liquid milk
and no one



lion,

there's a
montagu,
end
and other


she lay in pink

yet

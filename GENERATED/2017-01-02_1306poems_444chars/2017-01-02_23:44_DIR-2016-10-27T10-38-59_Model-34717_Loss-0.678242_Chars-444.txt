    TO SLOGA,   


sliding there equivocation

                    i found the mason 
         the wolf alluring in women 
                      toen there. no high pride in chalk--
mah old man. it is standing in tarnish. 
                             i thought 

they have gone life up our cube-- 
toundless spoiled eldor scholars   
the curves of his eyes, 
               were enough to it,          

we still, she yielding 
tarnished fait

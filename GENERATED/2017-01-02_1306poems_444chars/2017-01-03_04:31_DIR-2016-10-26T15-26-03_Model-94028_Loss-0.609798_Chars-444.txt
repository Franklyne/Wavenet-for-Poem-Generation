 EVENING SUFFER,


what mushrooms into my own sublimity
of a will that it's too red
i was finished.
this, the large edgar
of the feet of the southrest stand of through their wing

a hideous and full of this deep with mercy
my chin notebook--

why not takes this
day a poem to desipate for the stress.
paul is gone, heartbeats
a sort of coyote, 
my old triumphed little momentario,
and astan's not take it shampoo,
i can't stand up,.
then why do he

 THE MEN CLOSED WITH WONDER'S


 starting to sleep
 whose names, can whether and bloods
 exchange of the fen.
 the sand asleep
 in no hinge where,
 we bare ahead of her wrinkled
 and battle cyst the lid hard
 and pressed in hand, a region
 as a hand cut through me.
  
 we had seas
 wherever the last
 yet so they are past 
gods? negative
 in a dream heater,
 i tell he's girl
 running tree.


wello there. no gettine time
 loosens at the skin
 in

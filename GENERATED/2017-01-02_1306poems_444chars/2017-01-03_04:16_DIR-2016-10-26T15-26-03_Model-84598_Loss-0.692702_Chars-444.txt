 BUZZING THE TEMPEST--MY FLESH, NO TALK 


daring on my lapping sound of mentor have dreamed
by earth, ends, and then the hall of youth, and snowy shove
under the sweat of which we mean it washes...


it had it? ah boston days four gospel on the sidewalk and chese 
and redefined masks, bread and talk over the world
where mental green devoted, adultered a different king,
the one you've missing what must be names i'm at the facts
in your clothes

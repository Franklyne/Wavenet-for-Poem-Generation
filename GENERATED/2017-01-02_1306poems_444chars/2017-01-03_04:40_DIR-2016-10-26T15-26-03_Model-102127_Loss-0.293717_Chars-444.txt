 WERE GREEDY AS CLEARED, PASSING,


 walking from the raspbed of my window
 and the images and the lyre just keeps unlatched
 anax sute bawling they're all sends me,
 and everything approaching that's tallest paradise.
 and the tipped wires. i hope cleared.  the maternity
 a place to ache, beginning. the retired and pibis,
 and any care of july, line press and smeared.
  
 i have the buildings, their sticks through the screen door
 in the jack

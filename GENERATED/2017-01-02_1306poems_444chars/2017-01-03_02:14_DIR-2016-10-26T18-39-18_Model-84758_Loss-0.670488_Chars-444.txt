 A DRUM WHERE THE GROUND. ROCKY CHILDISH TO GET PERFECT DOWN


 held in the ruck imbala to all back from beds
        but your half dawn, a place & for my
 and lack mindless pyramid time the cold time that
through, civil they open when we caught my skin?
    .
a bit i stown in isolation, but more enough in her list?
no rummage at my shepherd in theste, where
 to fathomless and burn to the baby, a publisher . . .

          NEW, 


from under strength              we fail too preise 
              where i call you made 
                when we can undert
          amid the sun set, 
               freeze, away in light.
              a curve on silver creatures 

in dust, across the halfway, silently 
where the horehouse wall remaining thunder. 
                 emerged to the windowsilliant 

and unmatched at you hold stopped people 
out of stars aquit

        A STOP SHE THOUSAND SPRAYS IN THE DAY'S NEW GRASS



holding of vermouth chalk by everything's eye, 
     but passing after judgments,
 and the silences of metaphor, printed
to be what world's never since power over fame

 more deer came from meat as good and
help me from crowdedpist, his responsibility
ye nowhere all impose these boys mattor,
     the aria

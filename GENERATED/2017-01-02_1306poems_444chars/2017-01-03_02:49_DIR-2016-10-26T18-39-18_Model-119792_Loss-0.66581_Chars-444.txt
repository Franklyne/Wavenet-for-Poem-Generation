 YOU TALK TO CATCH   


away
 
  

on the runs on my life
so much 
machine is one things
me
 waiting that midnight the fluttering near again
if you band in an incidently down
who are the zenior
comedy girl...in in a law
in his eagle

in which to pull at our tongue murderous the stars, 
lurches empty hands, 
the billows inside our broken

sweaty conduity nowhere only then
has no rom, you don't ever has done,
doused by a man
will not paracle pea

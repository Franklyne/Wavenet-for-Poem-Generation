 A WEVERISH


 faces jarry finkling
a city of length. the glittering,
i kest only even now
and mean
 pushed our behether wrinkle arm 
i could be the getting and stones
 over myself up skipped beyond
 he's snails loud not, 
but its nose her when the starry cattle
 nearer. 
 powerful underpressional afternoon roon,
 they said there great to a hill
 openly gazed a city of london,
 the beauty-baht--yet i want to speak it.

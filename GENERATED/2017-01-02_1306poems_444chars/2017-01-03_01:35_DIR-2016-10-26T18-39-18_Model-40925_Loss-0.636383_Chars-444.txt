 HER.


i've groaning out, deep in, feels past 
  
  
  
 in unresents, chants the islenders
 membery do the game
 that pausing.
 my knives
  
 begins this                          


in your head stop                   but the jagger stars.
 don't what muted to surviving,
  
 the small with a hand spider smell
 two merciful
 jesus for my blood on the cliff,
                      scarce of the street that autumn,
  
 indeference it overwronini

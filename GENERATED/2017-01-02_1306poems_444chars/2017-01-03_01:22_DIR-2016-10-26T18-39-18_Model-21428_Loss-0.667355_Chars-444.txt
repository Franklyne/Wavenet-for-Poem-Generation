 ISLANDS ACROSS THE YEAR'S FEET   


craze again to dew out attocoover lay willows 
countless left always stupefied in their lawn behind your 

out of peerly et down towards and full of the ventrilot--

o can't have the morning of ever being my mathematics burns   
mystery, kick the liquid viness to the naomi and doom, 
so i, the hero, as the delicious heaven?

tell alres whislanside my yardrous behind 
saying as a cillars, not those pelican,

 ADMIRAL


      the savage explosive    
every sky, or leaves now player,
each from country
the devil and crab laid the me
flitting my century   make's 
stiff-equal things just above?


sears unto seems me for the darker
weather each a dull, myths 
or even the bought faces
if
to copped and word mine
for number a small figure abiding

like possessed, the harts
of fear the lichly lord fling
spirit of
war areas set people

ginger of radio
shadow

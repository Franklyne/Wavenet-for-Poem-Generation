 WEEK


 lying a greeting ice, i wish
 & there isn't a falling holy the right on highly pionically   
              what they keep her headtlessly, partially 
a class herd breath, dancing in the stargirm. 
             thrice as one grunts of singing
the archer copse me weather once
                                      to know what they counter.
  
 a blur of me
  
 
darken night. 
                           truanded
for flame who i flooded

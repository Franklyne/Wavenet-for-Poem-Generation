 TO SIT ON HIS BACK.   


what we might, thy ravishing move, 
scarled in tears, and sen was laid and revels 
far beyond rumor the flowers with her long stirrs, 
made it upon my art, but make me when, 
invites as i perfect thick, that once not in vain. 
to mourn, to the voices of store felicity 
while his thunders, then slaughter in the spring. 



on stick in her unheard, and thoughts,, 
press venus, flying of far human joys 
sharp in the alms

 GOOD TO A BROKEN DROP, HEAI


in the devil, outside, its plumb in a noisy
from my hand of distant calm pocks at sparkle 
kick and go, soon, thestosement 
handcuffeets and gates and beyond weep. 
 for that blue pink circling in a bird.
i behaved, not roil'd outlook its great world, 
blands of b. my disco
a map of city look, rich, the girl
for whom i lie alone been eating.

you didn't have gotten, & joined illustration,
that thought is the plan

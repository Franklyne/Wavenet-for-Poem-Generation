             YOU HAVE NO ACQUAIN, AND I'VE SEEN           MYSELF DOWN


 danced asleep 
glass first
     john dead well
shame         and you
once i shall shirt.

one man i left no garde
 first,
                                remakerused as bundled glass 
    edging parates the poplars.
a
melody meaning us like since ghosted
          and still lead.


you were lost point or the book, garbage to run

native on my ducts might
and several face

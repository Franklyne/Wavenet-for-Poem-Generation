        IN HER SOUL OF THE PLASTER


 like a rupture,
                           before the sad gets we just let
 no death had been turns but on the hawkle chalk
       floridians pounds.
  
                                                  the shape of blasted string
  
 the summer, through dry grasses 
                     with her head into the cloud.

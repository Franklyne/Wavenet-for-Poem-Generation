 BLUENESS NOTHING,


 scruglic wintry, brother. fox working
 and a broom to london danse,
my beloved back, my vows furniture,
 but not a ragged world. how grematic
of the beginning of the nocturne
 who warm beneath the nerves a sheep take
  
 a patcher grounds, but the whale?
 belied, but his grief to convey
  
 good folks to find a quarteth,
 the milk of hade, my gentledged me and you
who looks growing voice clutched 
from body to the purple

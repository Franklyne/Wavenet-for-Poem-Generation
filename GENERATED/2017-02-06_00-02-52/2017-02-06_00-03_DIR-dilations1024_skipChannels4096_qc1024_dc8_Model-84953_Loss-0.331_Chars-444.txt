 THE WRECKAGE CRAWL IMMENSE


 from the straw black champain-rilken chase,
 or dry.

tangled from a bike that hide the same
 her subtle and when the sunset night
 of the thrill of woods of his whole body,
 begin to rhymes back.

 about the baker like a nick, but loose
 on the talking belts, those mente,

            my dad's feet at all

 IN THE SKY, 


parakeet we mutter everythings on the trees.

in my hands.   down the map of inf flangster.
 july, with gypsy, et less--
stars & tumbled on a ripe from woven.
for broke. the noxious bird seed
of daphne, i am ashamed for chans, 
to make money, a corridor
and cast outvin them dry
its bumping with oarlings
tell the door can sung would weep
each attack to the passive
souls at the line rise pull 
to eat their easter weddings

 


yo

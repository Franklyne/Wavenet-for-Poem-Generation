 THE WOODEN WORLD 


 the dress, that her stereo, and in the seer
 my head for dumpisified kitchen hush of child 
when the sun's gold stands, theu they fought, hope.
 
 
 make a bride-vale air of the girl unclasp--
 their weight swing, and all night
 it was pamos them, lie stirring into you
and its that this glimpse and next. then birds
and dambituration days i'm in the marshes
 like in the shadow birds from the boats dills his sigh,
 jesus ye

 IN FLARE, AGREE QUARTS


 for an one trouped, no match

in ner craved in the crowd
 it's truly the violent to me.


every rock her pretty,
 dirt was so d'escore hello.


from the heaven disc the street

no harsh, just me things belongs
 of grown and deserving.
the prop's smile
we heaven, or all the 
the wind grewed a joke

and after eventual severant
 nearly for hooded
to discern than what our own--


the grasses loose
the atlantic andalusia

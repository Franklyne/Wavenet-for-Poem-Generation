 WAKING HIS BUS TO BE BEAUTIFUL DREAM.




i am not a farther gloss


i feel a map 
only the things up
 and dog as i now go
is somewhere
you shall change, after alive or union.

if never sounded on all

the moon closed as you 
with amates
shone big as late and
the things leaves haunts. 

moved a banana and nogue is revenge dark and rom,

a woman now an almost
and eagles alone.
how money pulling
full of its own.

a bearskin stars over the small

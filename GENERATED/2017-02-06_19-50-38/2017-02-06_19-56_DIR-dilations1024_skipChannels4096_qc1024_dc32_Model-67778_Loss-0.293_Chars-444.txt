 FORGIVE ON


 when his sea is what it could under the garden. how does he
 that saliva, hawk as a year ago.
 young man in snow, or or finished
 calls through the left winds raised,
 roads and volumes full of her legs
 madlettes vervored virtues of men,
     it's a blender blories
     loving on
 typing with me
  
 glossaw erect on producing with pleasure.
 i thought at it crushes & to me
 the idis civil one who line liars foretold
 in the nun

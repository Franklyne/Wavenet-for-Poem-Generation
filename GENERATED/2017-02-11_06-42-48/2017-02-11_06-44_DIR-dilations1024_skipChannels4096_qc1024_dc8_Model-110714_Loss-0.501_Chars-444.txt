 USED PALACES WHICH A BLACK SCRIPTURE


looking in her uncreases, and solvents, wave-wots 
 my eyes i wash she were fury of hombles   
seconds the nearing when god. a calendar alphabet
 spoke noosed the meditation and screws that set so conferent
and the hearse and never strung. a mirror and snake.

and by nodding room of my prisoner screaming in the earth,
weaving with her machines convolvulus.
they bother silent from the shampions baptismal

 BLACK FED IN A FOAM



so i braggy with the honey books, she sat his soul.
the sun has to you to be tuned in
 by the money icy gone and dryadela-schools.


you're not pass out, she can't turn to tell him
 introspective baritone tattoos head you.
  
 all tight on a string bartered, is clown apart.
 i walk in the sum of breeze between the tongue-light 
in the leg this is not to be keeps to awake are just for vales
scattered by blue joys rhyming

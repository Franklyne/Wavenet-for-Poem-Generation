 THEM URG'D WHORE COULD SEE


were o'er the baby is loose as a darkening staircase
abandoned the cars to a covert contrafuck,
 while a tighted flowers she was, somewhere the enemy juice you from themselves
 never spoke in beds, our panyons of song.


i want my mind emptiness, crater to her uncle.


the imperial girl, the wind has its appalled sea tight been dressed
  
 i felt it up trying net, unseemly of the first time

in the dance of rock.

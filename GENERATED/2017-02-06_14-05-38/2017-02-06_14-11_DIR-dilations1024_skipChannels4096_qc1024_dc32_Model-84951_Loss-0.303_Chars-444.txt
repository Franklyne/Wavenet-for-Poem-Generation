 WALKS AS WE START TRUCK, SHE TURNED TO THE REAL


 but mother, the air. but, cap. was stopping with muffins.
 long ago her strife. an answer, like the river.
 the sky bulb forever of the afternoon, who lie in its nest.


the plain reading to our brake into veil
and nine always or cover broken street with faith,
 heated in disinfelt here a lunawise
march on a view who will breath bank,
 where plans and i'm wrapped under her off
so i lean over,

 TO ROAR 


casual recals like those
and you deeath the sky
the triangle below
 conquered stretched nuns.

the stone of light.
 the cellos displeased       the squeak
 on struggle the other, the trees a-tyrak

at the toils man standsting, scorn?
he left them home to vomit,
crushed over the fall in fact,
 immense comes like happiness.




i don't know hi never shots
 the whole,
the covers for it
he throw
 piluhging for cones
 their stams.

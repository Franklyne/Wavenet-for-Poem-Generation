     YOU THINK OF,


 atonement as burial.         thin chair light
  
 after a train of feathered eighty one others,
 and blank a banker the future disappear.
 the moist cement both hushed at all.


being men then on reverberate,
 and the shadowed grass turned off lack,
 the way i know the husk of joating toward
 to run the rooms, the quiet clay moving
 of the south of strong over as they mean
 shaking land and stands of tortoises.

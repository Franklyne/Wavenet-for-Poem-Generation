                       AND THE ENVELOPE



a ghost tears, fall in your glorious house.
like a corpsmith, one left

standing the future we can sleep underfoot
began tom, when there you

when i figure you, mom eight checkbook.
the body head in a leather year.

he tries his hands them in late time
out from the rose with painted, bloom-fork
mealwhile, embankments like a ghost
to my self skin.

her hands are thought . . .

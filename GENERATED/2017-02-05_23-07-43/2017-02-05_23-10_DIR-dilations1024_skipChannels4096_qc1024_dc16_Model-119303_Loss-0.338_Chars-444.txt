 FROM JOANNE, NEXT TO RECRIMINATE FEW YEARS


police rolls untemple, when purple street
you would sit on the lypochet browns of sentence
as his colors theft theme man clockfuls. 

why don't you find the berformance we endure
and none of us sleep is moist. toe grey,
and i cried or to sway mean to branch, dodged by the blunt.

after all those creep about, onward wings,
and struggling.
in the morning plus gluble

how shouldered jodi.
they tie-yos

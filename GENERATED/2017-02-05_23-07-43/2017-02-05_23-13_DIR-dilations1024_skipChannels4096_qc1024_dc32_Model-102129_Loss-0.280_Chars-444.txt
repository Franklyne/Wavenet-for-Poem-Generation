 AT THE MARROW WIND,


 say he spent woman is a lither jeweled these creation.
 days in the sparkle of wandering facts
 a hopeless at bong-juice of his milk as artifact of serpents.
  
 exactly draws laundromat.
 from hang on and on the parting
 and lost our grief, this mother leave
 the old daughters
 of the pastel bed in white wine.
 i am the pages of heart to the
 the land, balconies numbers.
 i am on pure it for a . . .
  


their mate nat

 THOUSANDS OF APRIL,


no
the catastrophic eyes.
  
 el clothed his elegant falls
 whose stretches in
 and burned road
 get over these are hath
 if i looked back in public
 strolled themselves
 galora's
. and then
 on the flut of a man love
 the small place
 and they
 pressure the tartar inclines.
  
 & night the poem
  
 i'm the stage in me, not her
 houses
 a strange back to them and
 through the sand
 and think he was bad hated
 the sea-ear

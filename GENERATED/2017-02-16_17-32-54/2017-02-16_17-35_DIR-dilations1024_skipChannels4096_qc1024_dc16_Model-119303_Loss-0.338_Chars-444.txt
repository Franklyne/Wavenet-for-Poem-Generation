          THE HIGH SEWN TO THEM




even at my gowns were to my shoulder down,
 my face was not exactly in town
 
           out the moon from youth their awkwardness 
              meaning the world of two ground
 the tracks are left into story,
              tropical beggarmand bob-white
         whose hats without the ghost
  
           the deer n try and your rudde born
 against my message us for holding fans
  
      that it had dresser

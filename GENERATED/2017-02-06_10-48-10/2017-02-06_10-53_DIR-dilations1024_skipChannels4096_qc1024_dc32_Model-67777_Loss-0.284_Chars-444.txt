 ACROSS THE STREET


stands out in plum tree,
the motorcycle green is hardy trumpets the
wheat was out and & dis. 

when i loved me? a bastard is the silver
i left the more the knee

be submerged birds, but look a tuber.
stern when love a forest things.
i am a bim in the lifte shelf.
and as forethode body bask our slaves
i felt wobbly as fantasy.
she always sight down

     RUSHING THE HEAT OUT OF THE SKY IS BORN.


i have a painted or a waitress         & as we ought a dark.
don't quite           amazed, obscene thing's ok.
         driving janquenders in the anemones.

at the noises line certain through dirt into the kitchen's
bones the white hers
beneath his eyes, wall bypast me around us

let me my son.
my brother things he'd had no she did

and his family.

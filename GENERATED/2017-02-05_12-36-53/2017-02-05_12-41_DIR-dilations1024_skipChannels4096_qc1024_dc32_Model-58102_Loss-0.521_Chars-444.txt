 DROUGHT


 me back your own swatch of the brown

  
 and of the other world next to
 watches to walk
 fashes that at night.

 it is a prophet love to black
  
  
  
  
    

  
 the prayers of a line of myself
 leafing thy months of space
 those year touched the hill.
 and backfire stretching
  
 what in the intervals of
 she cribs out something you
 in memory, mostly banquets, 
 to carry white. the hour
 to add it was discovered
 in chance.

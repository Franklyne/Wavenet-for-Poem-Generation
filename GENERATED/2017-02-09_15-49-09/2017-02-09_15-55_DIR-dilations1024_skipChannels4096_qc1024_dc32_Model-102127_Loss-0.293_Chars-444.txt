 MEWORK AN OCEAN.


        from sight isn't mine eyes no sparkling immense
  
 both black cuptured with bottles
     and ats and nostalgic.
 over the little storms
  
 the bops makes the
  
 swelling the far to a bullhennes of
 to be your watered.
  

            dreamily
 even sound--when never had rocked
 in one that is to bed.
  
 at noon to an end. we like
        the drinking lot
       the body as the train
 mirror so so flames.
  
 loo

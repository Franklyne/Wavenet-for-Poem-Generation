 THE APPALOOSA



tremble two deep across the buildings, the high merciful.
    no doubt.
books above an okra
 in the butter and then,
 an urged for,
 i stuff in a woman's
 he wanted to
 that she couldn't
  
 more than memory would sit, 
  
 the worth itself. not cries,
 and crazy in the loom.

 they both prey.
  
 wherever the thoughts walk 
and cobwebing.

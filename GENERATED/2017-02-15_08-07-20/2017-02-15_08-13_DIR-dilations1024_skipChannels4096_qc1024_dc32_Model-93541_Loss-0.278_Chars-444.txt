 BASS HEADS DECEMBER,


lam flannel                         for near muffin,
 rove deaf.
  
 relish and shovels, and his muscles
        my one sacks of sensnikable nami,
 and heaven, don't we heard it as unpicked
 i am a cross put shiny where he was discover
 there is a seasoned gesual kolling swerved,
                      carved by in the wetting of the switch and
 tear and funks
the trees are sea standing to where
 that misty story yelled

 THAT WOMAN OWN ILL


organizes over waiting to the pollow wherever. 
ask your life...lowing that birds he wants
into the scholar waves in the cold life
pastures on our hair of army of unequivocation,
thy condition. the hopes of grass and bay.
i know absurd it. book in the dark
of his hands gone has vanished.

a light in corset i design

never minds the afternoon, 
sort i used to say so?
the universe 
my whole body spill
the walls, the animals

 IN YOUR GLOVE,


 and crawl on the dublin.

only the march
 and the woman chance torn from the language
 to grow when the more's represents from
  
 in the lucky pile of your image 
  
 instruments at the carpet
 the city is cut father to look--
 he light of meaning. the white flowered lips
 to hell me. not. summer. see you should sleep

 it will see there be an elephant smocked our black-and-paci-lan?
  
  
 the curvings nestled on barnacle.

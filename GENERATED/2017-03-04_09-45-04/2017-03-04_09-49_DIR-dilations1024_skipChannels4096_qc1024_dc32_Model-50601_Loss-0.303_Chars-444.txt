 STATION WITH WANTING LINE


 is the mind lava for losing raided deeds
 to be cuffed sandals whirls plean 
 the plaining pang the floor law
 fingers-a-beg roof convex by thin jaw o ball
 always the visible in the shrinking sun
was chey for thoe at vivion and cohe
 may be less knot how stragglerians,
 and hydrozal  hither purse in the fest.
  
 the man on the water wrench cadillac
 tis mouth and boomed 
 the moon all the museum
 i'm in the mist

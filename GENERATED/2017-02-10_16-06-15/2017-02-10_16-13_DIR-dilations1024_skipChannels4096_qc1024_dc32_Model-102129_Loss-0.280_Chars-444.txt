 THE GROW


from the men to the one of us. here's a gleam

the smell of days, a vague brove tension.
  
 a finger myself that of us.
 
 a word as he had to choose a bit the banks
 sweet confess a film shades and elk
 is difcards that somehow walk in the tedious
 later cloud every turn upon carnation,
 the blue jacket gnometh i'm off the complaint.
 collapsing its face like a farthest barns,
 fashions that dancestone to illuminate museums.

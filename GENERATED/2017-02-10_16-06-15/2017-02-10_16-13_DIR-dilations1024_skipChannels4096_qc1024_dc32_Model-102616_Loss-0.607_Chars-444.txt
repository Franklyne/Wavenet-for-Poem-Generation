 OF EATEN BECAUSE YOU


along the phone under gods,
crushed undefinitesimal daytonic ean
over a party mask.
i am standing an old ireland. 
you feel your heart.

the lost on the bones of a woman
and gathered mouths and how china
and a huge can trade,
only a glazegoers of the dark
on a man above the end 
                           i stood
on sunday morning's braces

a cathedral skeleton and is
water, the sheen or murder
and hands cleans
& did no

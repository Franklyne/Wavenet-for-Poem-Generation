 OF RAIN   


of light so as waving 
and windowering riches 
are set my breath 
or like a traceries 
through prayer on this 
in the time there. 

lobbin blare incidental exiles. 

slackensteads in the galaxy 
jumbled to your men plays 

in my mindescribably your presence, 
naked into a fiftrance 
i'm going to her tiny bathing   
had inflected gape and whistle   
community it can see? read again,   
and on daddy-blown in the billowy to-day 
out

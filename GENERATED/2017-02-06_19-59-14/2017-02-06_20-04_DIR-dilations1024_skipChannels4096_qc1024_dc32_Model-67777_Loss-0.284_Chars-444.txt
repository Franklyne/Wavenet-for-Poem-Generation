 FELL IN THE SPHERES.


 one persepolis sad left his throngs, work
 blue of the broken cloud of blues that moves
 looks at a catarrant wide flying,
 what words the wood and a throat worlds,
 mauve was as though i'll break down to explaining
 to a hawk-mark as he was cleaned-up special pit,
 & all things gave way, in discovering appears. 
 tide, as we alcohols that damnably thou out's as
 where about a poke and vacant lines and bridge.

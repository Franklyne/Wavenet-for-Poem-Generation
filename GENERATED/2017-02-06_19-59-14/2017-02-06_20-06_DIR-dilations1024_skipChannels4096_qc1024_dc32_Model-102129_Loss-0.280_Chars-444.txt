 LIKE THE WOMAN TREE OF US


 counted dumb on
 headfights sang
 containium like old pills of place.
 no reason the gusts from our
flashes of the zealot, check and fall
 
that the tale look, the future
 she wishes beneath my jugs
 path of a river broken

later, silent, ankles
who smesame jabbies that busts
 here waiting on and odors & trees
 the future of blip heli
 the sure built of steel
 
and man donkey table to a mind
 today where the cloth

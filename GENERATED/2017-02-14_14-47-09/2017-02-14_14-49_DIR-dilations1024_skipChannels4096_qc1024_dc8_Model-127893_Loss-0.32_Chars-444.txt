 NATURE'S SEWING



when i should say, whispers
where near is judge in new from her gate.

i support of lint, strapped under tenderness
 to judges stitchbuckl'd taken in trout,
 to be horror of human living,
for land, hulc where the origin,
       not in the nastened sun
 search the harvestring eyes.
 behold, the shadow ends
  
 aware to heaven
vine natural and red gas
but tuned trum buddha, which raretrack in the sink.
  
 something the cream

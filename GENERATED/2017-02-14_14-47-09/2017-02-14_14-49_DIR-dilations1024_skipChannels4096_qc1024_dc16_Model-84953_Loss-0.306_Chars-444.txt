 ON BY THE MIND,


 never flash fathom with good and reasons
 and then we were darken against
 the first wind words that couldn't yelled
 these things that had made.


i am heavy i watched.
  
 heart they call out
 a strange eyes
 trees again
 her motorcycle
and so i covered 
a lucky things above
 the things becomes
and state--look on being,
 starks and blank.
 treeliness.
  
 miss so the edge of the dead.
  
 make a band and flush
 that ghost

 IN PLACES


 lintel the migrant world to keep him my car to marke
 matter the thin fresh-other world
 from the senses of the sea and labar
 crying down from the ground, the seeds go down
in his stewards, twenty, holding panama pail.


for years go that the body's great corridor.
cool and five. nay two stone, myself
on blanketing night moonlight.
 let the occasion hammering dista


the iron sawing of again
 the s awning to carry me.

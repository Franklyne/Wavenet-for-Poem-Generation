 CLEVER.


 stick hands, a few from falling from the head
 to pretend in the gym,
who shoot on january dangling black turns.
  
 and the ford sundown                                              a noise wave
                  the frost friends
 of being peaching the malathrod cilan box
pensive i think of tuquent sounds a lie,
                            their drops of chocolate.
 who taste is blown and bright to understand
            
 still

 WE WERE THE OUT--EVEN.


 but logic like water from rattle dead.
i could be a dead world that climb to wheat?


 
    i thrust in bright and adored vase to hold back
 so stars compared here, kiss that comes out on the pound is daid
              adriente-challenge at a daughter
  
 in methink green porch in gold for favorite walls
 glinting their mine gomorrah calm.
wearing this infants out of me.

 HAND ONCE GAZE AT PITY.



it was a glass that buff but now
i am nothing
to immigres and a shrivelled daisy girl
like an introns and hang and direct of white wings


weapons our armpment, tomato loud 
i used to help wide adjact.
glowed with a yoga blanking we
of a plaque beads and knives

who july defy, like old man who died
to starved husks.
this was shadowy spinozalists
its labeled you are not like this town.
none should learn by curiosity

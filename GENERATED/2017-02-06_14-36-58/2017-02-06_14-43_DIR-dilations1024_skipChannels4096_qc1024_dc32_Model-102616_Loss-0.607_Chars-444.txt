 HELMET'S MOTHER NOT


the ones who had torn and room my dust
i mounted once against duncan grinds her son
southeast hallway till a space fallen fourteen
with stranger of the world, almost someone has a sack of palaces
it may died first babbles in resurrections

then lowered from the sensuality of poetry. 

tell me, she flatted the knife. even now i smelled inflammates that your face.
no one to far blanket and pagnation purpose a classroom....

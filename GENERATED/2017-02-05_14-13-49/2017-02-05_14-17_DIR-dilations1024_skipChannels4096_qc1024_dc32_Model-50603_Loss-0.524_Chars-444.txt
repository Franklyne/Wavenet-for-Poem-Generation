 ALONE AND CYMBALS, THAT I SAID


 savage, a blind manner. their seventh that softly zible
 in the sharp swells the radio in the backs,
 tall the poisoning, showing away into rain, what's why we were kind
  
 which would perform on the street in the pale,
 open and holding the toilet's sight i find a soul
 you hang fresh among with them from my lucent swallows
 cobalt names. palmetto the facous, and the bound.
 of fire. i think i would spin me

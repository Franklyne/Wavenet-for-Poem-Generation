 ONE TASTE 


my zinewood up secreted to wear gives 
being more explorer the lines drag 
i can never past 
beyond phantom a childteppit 
so we were amber almost jazz cleft 
of survival, my difference or words, and died   
a spandaest coy mad toothed,   
do my blooz cages from adderness   
beyond, with it is not immediate
ribboes all these i no loved her 
their mined weman ef we are, 
poured is what's become   
commencing their waves and coax

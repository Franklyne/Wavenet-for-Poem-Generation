 SHOUTING FROM


yoke

once against
 sirena.



today's hung over, envelopment for the more began,
 as if the radio,
  
 traveled on, i blame?
  
  
  
 i know what to live
somehow there feelest
 who sleeping unreturned nots up, mutual of horizon

smoothing depression. every hill pass they
 no one spirit of
 toll the moon 
he rubs and bird what for distance
 stairwells, brays
 of uniform stirring
 merely brought
skirts lost nick-stones
of reme

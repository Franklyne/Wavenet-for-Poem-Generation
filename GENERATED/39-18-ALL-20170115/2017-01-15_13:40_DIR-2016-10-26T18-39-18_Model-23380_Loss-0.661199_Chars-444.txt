 I'D LIKE HIM WHICH IS TURN


i, old man's imaginable, stevens' 
out of the rivers kept, iur another, 
show all the 'itless at the door, whatever
the stars         not each speckled
like a logged of among the guilt


& look my teeth highways chain
pork
like harvests of gold christ to come
still daring in plantel,
heat, aquinox given foam
and diet while 'a

the hero best the sun, magella 
knees them a kind
by root cob, keston? the
stamps and on

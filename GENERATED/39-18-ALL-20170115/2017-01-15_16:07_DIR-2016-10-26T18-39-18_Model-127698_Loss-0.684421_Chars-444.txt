            THROUGH LIFETIME'S TWANGING IT KIDNEY,



and the movers up
my parents from a hot summer barbari, watching   
the faded on disarraying slit haltshift. always . . .
 and the sky has are travel-napped 
       and loaded producting enough to sign for nome
i he branch cars sounds of light, my head .
  
 a bit wants a plastic river swall straight in early mile
    a joke pinching if i've thought i'd never walking the matter 
 and love,

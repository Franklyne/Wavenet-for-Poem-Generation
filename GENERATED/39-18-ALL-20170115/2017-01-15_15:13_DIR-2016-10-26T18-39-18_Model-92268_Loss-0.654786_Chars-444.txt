 SONG 


 abiding our
 this thick walks       scorchfrost. 
acrobassac chair who remedy in the darkness
that is someone cloak my mouth. it look
duscling the betrayed lights   
of this a gleam looked otherwove,
sipped, what's like warning of my
  
 the author of woman and biting memory music 
eternal in front of wants

possessed for the night years
is somewhere. we still potato and
sea one ordered opened tire 

a sensible breeze
a glass of whit

 RESEMBLE IN THE AIR


            in a sunday rest now arousals one you
 this treacherous soldiers--the nearned sunder this places and hygiene he giving mine
 that was over the world is lost too much crazed the rote suddenly
with his false experiment time smoke them offer 


i saw o twirl crossing 
 the breath & belly, and limit
 try and how it would need, but audience grace at the yoke.
  
 ting to wait in me. something?
 at dusk.
 
the play

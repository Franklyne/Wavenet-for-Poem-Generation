 WINDS


 across the murmuring tents
everything more trembles
 alive.
  
 the perfect rashiking ceily nod,
 but, please you better,
 held 
 will die
  
  
  
  
 shuffling on their weight morning
 is the toilet silence and cannot cure
 each alive. elate of friendshipalities
 new might braided and my ten
  
 gold and stripenetman, birches
 warm, at an acquito, also oblings.
  
 .  should get think this is worth
 be so knit rome lights i was
in

 AFRICA COUGH


                     the butter noise 
     fruit turn never look at everything statues
 as they most jazz and back them
 beats beyond something yourself against
moons me back ashes of our baskets in ammonia 
 stormed this generation at sea almost to draughts
 as forced or the icy laughter bath soot
 this eard and emperors me in the sunlight?


her hair & good, his shirts the old cans.
 later harbor and the dry assail announce

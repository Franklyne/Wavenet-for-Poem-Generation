   E PARENNAL.


i bring the coasts of time.
  
 and feel you on her hand. outside,
 then when i grab thump listening strut,
 and that which a suffering about the hill of poety-six

 and beyond the state of the horn-in-law
 in the vast loaded down

 we fend the holy split wrapped gems
 in the hand-laced rooms
 abandoned chivalry black to drank

 I DO 



the glittering animals to deliver 
to lift my gloves in my hand and the push's tree 

alive them. 

ancient clouds kiss by light, 
my bong-faced, dollhwith their torturing   
shoulders, noxious terrible-- 
& acan the, 
rout on the soverers of the track, 
the imagine-eyed river. 

do i row visible 
who light or the feliz 
this starved chide iris, kat he each other 
at their rhymes and a place to live you--
s. fooln wifthon, only a pip

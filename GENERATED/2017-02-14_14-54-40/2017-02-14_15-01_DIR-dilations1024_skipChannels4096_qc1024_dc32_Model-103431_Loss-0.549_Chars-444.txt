 YOUYL SINGS 


our image in tugging mamps on penmane of   
      bust in panama--she sings cause on the dark insistences   
away from our woman, there 
white somehow from the pastel exact 
and the sake of the shed out contradictory circards   
and here who recalls it wakes in gelmarks 

america children weard in park. 

i am dancing angeless sleephing of foads in at- 
   walks of my sweetest jiggling across the plane of moss
